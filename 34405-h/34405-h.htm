<p><span class="bold">BASSO-RELIEVO<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (Ital. for &ldquo;low relief&rdquo;), the term applied to
sculpture in which the design projects but slightly from the plane
of the background. The relief may not project at all from the
original surface of the material, as in the sunken reliefs of the
Egyptians, and may be nearly flat, as in the Panathenaic procession
of the Parthenon. In the early 19th century the term
<i>basso-relievo</i>, or &ldquo;low relief,&rdquo; came to be employed loosely for all
forms of relief, the term <i>mezzo-relievo</i> having already dropped
out of general use owing to the difficulty of accurate application.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BASS ROCK, THE,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> a small island in the Firth of Forth, about
2 m. from Canty Bay, Haddingtonshire, Scotland. It is circular
in shape, measuring a mile in circumference, and is 350 ft. high.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page498" id="page498"></a>498</span>
On three sides the cliffs are precipitous, but they shelve towards
the S.W., where landing is effected. The Bass Rock is an intrusive
mass of phonolitic trachyte or orthophyre. No nepheline
has been detected in the rock, but analcite is present in small
quantity together with abundant orthoclase and green soda-augite.
It bears a close resemblance to the eruptive masses of
North Berwick Law and Traprain Law, but is non-porphyritic.
It is regarded by Sir A. Geikie as a plug filling an old volcanic
vent, from which lava emanated during the Calciferous Sandstone
period. It used to be grazed by sheep, of which the mutton
was thought to be unusually good, but its principal denizens are
sea-birds, chiefly solan geese, which haunt the rock in vast
numbers. A lighthouse with a six-flash lantern of 39,000 candle
power was opened in 1002. For a considerable distance E. and
W. there runs through the rock a tunnel, about 15 ft. high,
accessible at low water. St Baldred, whose name has been
given to several of the cliffs on the shore of the mainland,
occupied a hermitage on the Bass, where he died in 756. In the
14th century the island became the property of the Lauders,
called afterwards Lauders of the Bass, from whom it was
purchased in 1671 by government, and a castle with dungeons
was erected on it, in which many Covenanters were imprisoned.
Among them were Alexander Peden (1626-1686), for four years,
and John Blackadder (1615-1686), who died there after five
years&rsquo; detention. At the Revolution four young Jacobites
captured the Rock, and having been reinforced by a few others,
held it for King James from June 1691 to April 1694, only
surrendering when threatened by starvation. Thus the island
was the last place in Great Britain to submit to William III.
Dismantled of its fortifications in 1701, the Bass passed into the
ownership of Sir Hew Dalrymple, to whose family it belongs. It
is let on annual rental for the feathers, eggs, oil and young of the
sea-birds and for the fees of visitors, who reach it usually from
Canty Bay and North Berwick.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BASSUS, AUFIDIUS,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> a Roman historian, who lived in the
reign of Tiberius. His work, which probably began with the
civil wars or the death of Caesar, was continued by the elder
Pliny, who, as he himself tells us, carried it down at least as far
as the end of Nero&rsquo;s reign. The <i>Bellum Germanicum</i> of Bassus,
which is commended, may have been either a separate work or
a section of his general history. The elder Seneca speaks highly
of him as an historian, but the fragments preserved in that
writer&rsquo;s <i>Suasoriae</i> (vi. 23) relating to the death of Cicero, are
characterized by an affected style.</p>

his sixth satire to him, and whose works he edited (Schol. on
Persius, vi. 1). He is said to have lost his life in the eruption of
Vesuvius (79). He had a great reputation as a poet; Quintilian
(<i>Instit</i>, x. 1. 96) goes so far as to say that, with the exception of
Horace, he was the only lyric poet worth reading. He is also
identified with the author of a treatise <i>De Metris</i>, of which considerable
fragments, probably of an abbreviated edition, are extant
(ed. Keil, 1885). The work was probably originally in verse,
and afterwards recast or epitomized in prose form to be used as
an instruction book. A worthless and scanty account of some
of the metres of Horace (in Keil, <i>Grammatici Latini</i>, vi. 305),
bearing the title <i>Ars Caesii Bassi de Metris</i> is not by him, but
chiefly borrowed by its unknown author from the treatise
mentioned above.</p>

Julius Secundus, one of the speakers in Tacitus <i>Dialogus de

was generously treated by Vespasian, who made him a present

<p><span class="bold">BASSVILLE,<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Basseville</span>, <b>NICOLAS JEAN HUGON DE</b>
(d. 1793), French journalist and diplomatist, was born at Abbeville
on the 7th of February 1753. He was trained for the
priesthood, taught theology in a provincial seminary and then
went to Paris. Here in 1784 he published <i>Éléments de mythologie</i>
and some poems, which brought him into notice. On the recommendation
of the prince of Condé he became tutor to two young
Americans travelling in Europe. With them he visited Berlin,
made the acquaintance there of Mirabeau, and became a member
of the Berlin Academy Royal. At the outbreak of the Revolution
he turned to journalism, becoming editor of the <i>Mercure international</i>.
Then, through the Girondist minister Lebrun-Tondu,
he entered the diplomatic service, went in May, 1792, as secretary
of legation to Naples and was shortly afterwards sent, without
official status, to Rome. Here his conduct was anything but
diplomatic. He at once announced himself as the protector of
the extreme Jacobins in Rome, demanded the expulsion of the
French <i>émigrés</i> who had taken refuge there, including the
&ldquo;demoiselles Capet,&rdquo; and ordered the <i>fleur-de-lys</i> on the
escutcheon of the French embassy to be replaced by a picture
of Liberty painted by a French art student. He talked at large
of the &ldquo;purple geese of the Capitol&rdquo; and met the remonstrances
of Cardinal Zelada, the papal secretary of state, with insults.
This enraged the Roman populace; a riot broke out on the 13th
of January 1793, and Bassville, who was driving with his family
to the Corso, was dragged from his carriage and so roughly
handled that he died. The affair was magnified in the Convention
into a deliberate murder of the &ldquo;representative of the Republic&rdquo;
by the pope&rsquo;s orders. In 1797 by an article of the treaty of
Tolentino the papal government agreed to pay compensation
to Bassville&rsquo;s family. Among his writings we may also mention

France</i> (Paris 1790; English trans. London, 1790).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BASTAR,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> a feudatory state of British India, in the Chattisgarh
division of the Central Provinces; area, 13,062 sq. m. In
1901 the population was 306,501, showing a decrease of 1%
compared with an apparent increase of 58% in the preceding
decade. Estimated revenue £22,000; tribute £1100. The
eastern part of Bastar is a flat elevated plateau, from 1800 to
2000 ft. above the level of the sea, the centre and N.W. portions
are very mountainous, and the southern parts consist of hills and
plains. On the plateau there are but few hills; the streams
run slowly and the country is a mixture of plain and undulating
ground covered by dense <i>sál</i> forests. Principal mountains of the
district: (1) a lofty range which separates it from the Sironcha
district; (2) a range of equal height called the Bela Dila lying
in the centre of the district; (3) a range running N. and S.
near Narayanpur; (4) Tangri Dongri range, running E. and W.;
(5) Tulsi Dongri, bordering on the Sabari river and the Jaipur
state. There is also a small range running from the river Indravati
to the Godavari. The Indravati, the Sabari and the Tal
or Talper, are the chief rivers of the district; all of them affluents
of the Godavari. The soil throughout the greater portion of
Bastar consists of light clay, with an admixture of sand, suited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>499</span>
for raising rice and wet crops. In the jungles the Marias, who
are among the aboriginal tribes of Gond origin, raise kosra
(<i>Panicum italicum</i>) and other inferior grains. Aboriginal races
generally follow the migratory system of tillage, clearing the
jungle on selected patches, and after taking crops for two or
three years abandoning them for new ground. They do not use
the plough; nor do they possess buffaloes, bullocks or cows;
their only agricultural implement is a long-handled iron hoe.
They are a timid, quiet, docile race, and although addicted to
drinking not quarrelsome. They inhabit the densest jungles
and are very shy, avoiding contact with strangers, and flying to
the hills on the least alarm; but they bear a good character for
honesty and truthfulness. They are very scantily dressed,
wear a variety of trinkets, with a knife, hatchet, spear, bow and
arrows, the only weapons they use. Their hair is generally shaved,
excepting a topknot; and when not shaved it gets into a matted,
tangled mass, gathered into a knot behind or on the crown.
The Marias and the Jhurias are supposed to be a subdivision of
the true Gond family. All the aboriginal tribes of Bastar worship
the deities of the Hindu pantheon along with their own national
goddess Danteswari.</p>

<p>Bastar is divided into two portions&mdash;that held by the Raja
or chief himself, and that possessed by feudatory chiefs under
him. The climate is unhealthy&mdash;fever, smallpox, dysentery
and rheumatism being the prevailing diseases. Jagdalpur,
Bijapur, Madder and Bhupalpatnam are the only places of any
note in the dependency, the first (on the Indravati river) being
the residence of the raja and the chief people of the state. The
principal products are rice, oil-seeds, lac, tussur silk, horns, hides,
wax and a little iron. Teak timber is floated down the rivers
to the Madras coast. A good road has brought Jagdalpur into
connexion with the railway at Raipur.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BASTARD<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (O. Fr. <i>bastard</i>, mod. <i>bâtard = fils de bast</i>, &ldquo;pack-saddle
child,&rdquo; from <i>bast</i>, saddle), a person born out of legal
wedlock. Amongst the Romans, bastards were classified as
<i>nothi</i>, children born in concubinage, and <i>spurii</i>, those not so
born. Both classes had a right of succession to their mother,
and the <i>nothi</i>, were entitled to support from their father, but had
no rights of inheritance from him. Both, however, had in other
respects most of the rights of citizenship. The Germanic law
was based upon an entirely different principle. It recognized
as legitimate only those whose parents were of the same social
rank. All others were regarded as bastards, and took the status
of the parent of inferior rank. The aim of all the Germanic codes
was to preserve purity of race, not to improve morals, for incestuous
unions are not censured. The influence of the Germanic
law lasted throughout the early feudal period, and bastards were
debarred rights of inheritance. In the 13th century the influence
of Roman law tended again to modify this severity. An exception
was probably made in the case of those whose fathers were
of royal blood, in which case it even seems that no stigma was
attached to the accident of their birth, nor did they suffer from
the usual disabilities as to inheritance which attended those of
illegitimate birth (Gregory of Tours, v. 25). Among the Franks
we find Theodoric I., a natural son of Clovis, sharing the kingdom
with the legitimate sons; Zwentibold, natural son of Arnulf, was
created king of Lorraine by his father in 895; and even William
the Conqueror actually assumed the appellation of bastard.</p>

<p>In English law a bastard still retains certain disabilities. His
rights are only such as he can acquire; for civilly he can inherit
nothing, being looked upon as the son of nobody, and sometimes
called <i>filius nullius</i>, sometimes <i>filius populi</i>. This, however, does
not hold as to moral purposes, <i>e.g.</i> he cannot marry his mother
or bastard sister. Yet he may gain a surname by reputation
though he has none by inheritance, and may even be made
legitimate and capable of inheriting by the transcendent power
of an act of parliament.</p>

<p>For poor-law purposes, all legitimate children take the settlement
of their father, but a bastard takes the settlement of its
mother. The mother of an illegitimate child is entitled to its
custody in preference to the father, and consequently the responsibility
of its support falls primarily on her. But the
English law has always recognized the principle that to a certain
extent the father must share in that responsibility. This, however,
was imposed not with the idea of furnishing the woman
with a civil remedy, nor to have a penal effect against the man,
but solely to prevent the cost of maintenance of the bastard child
from falling upon the parish. Indeed, the legislation upon the
subject, which dates back to 1576, was until 1845 an intimate
part of the poor law. The act of 1576, the basis of English
bastardy law, empowered justices to take order for the punishment
of the mother and reputed father of every bastard child
left to the care of the parish, and to charge the mother and
reputed father with the payment of a weekly sum or other
needful sustenance. Other acts were passed in 1609 and 1733,
enabling the mother of any child chargeable or likely to become
chargeable to the parish to secure the apprehension, and even
the imprisonment, of the father until he should indemnify the
parish, provisions which were made somewhat more stringent
by acts passed in 1809 and 1810. In 1832 a commission was
appointed to inquire into the operation of the poor laws, and
the commissioners in their report gave great attention to the
subject of bastardy. They reviewed the various acts from 1576
downwards and gave examples of their operation. The conclusion
to which the commissioners came was that the laws
&ldquo;which respect bastardy appear to be pre-eminently unwise,&rdquo;
and that they gave rise to many abuses. For example, the
weekly payment recovered by the parish was usually transferred
to the mother; even in many cases guaranteed. The commissioners
recommended that the mother alone should be responsible
for the maintenance of the child. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; they said,
&ldquo;is now the position of a widow, and there can be no reason for
giving to vice privileges which we deny to misfortune.&rdquo; Acting
on the recommendation of the commissioners the Poor Law
Amendment Act of 1834 endeavoured to discourage the principle
of making the putative father contribute by introducing a somewhat
cumbersome method of procedure. The trend of public
opinion proved against the discouragement of affiliation, and
an act of 1839 transferred jurisdiction in affiliation cases from
quarter-sessions to petty-sessions. A commission of inquiry on
the working of the bastardy acts in 1844 recommended &ldquo;that
affiliation should be facilitated,&rdquo; and, accordingly, by the
Bastardy Act of 1845 effect was given to this recommendation
by giving the mother an independent civil remedy against the
putative father and dissociating the parish altogether from the
proceedings. Subsequently, legislation gave the parish the right
of attaching, and in some cases suing for, money due from the
putative father for the maintenance of the child. The existing
law is set out under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Affiliation</a></span>.</p>

<p>The incapacities attaching to a bastard consist principally in
this, that he cannot be heir to any one; for being <i>nullius filius</i>,
he is therefore of kin to nobody, and has no ancestor from whom
an inheritable blood can be derived. Therefore, if there be no
other claimant upon an inheritance than such illegitimate child,
it escheats to the lord. And as bastards cannot be heirs themselves,
so neither can they have any heirs but those of their own
bodies; for as all collateral kindred consists in being derived
from the same common ancestor, and as a bastard has no legal
ancestor, he can have no collateral kindred, and consequently no
legal heirs, except such as claim by a lineal descent from himself.
And hence, if a bastard purchase land, and die seised therefor
without issue and intestate, the land escheats to the lord of the
fee. Originally a bastard was deemed incapable of holy orders,
and disqualified by the fact of his birth from holding any dignity
in the church; but this doctrine is now obsolete, and in all other
respects there is no distinction between a bastard and another
man. By the law of Scotland a bastard is not only excluded
from his father&rsquo;s succession, because the law knows no father
who is not marked out by marriage; and from all heritable
succession, whether by the father or mother, because he cannot
be pronounced lawful heir by the inquest in terms of the brief;
but also from the movable succession of his mother, because he
is not her lawful child, and legitimacy is implied in all succession
deferred by the law. But a bastard, although he cannot succeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>500</span>
<i>jure sanguinis</i>, may succeed by destination, where he is specially
called to the succession by entail or testament. In Scotland, as
in England, a bastard can have no legal heirs except those of his
own body; and hence, failing his lawful issue, the king succeeds
to him as last heir. Formerly bastards in Scotland without
issue of their own could not make a will, but this disability was
removed by a statute of 1835. If bastards or other persons
without kindred die intestate without wife or child, their effects
go to the king as <i>ultimus haeres</i>; but a grant is usually made of
them by letters patent, and the grantee becomes entitled to the
administration.</p>

<p>According to the common law, which is the law of England, a
bastard cannot be divested of his state of illegitimacy, unless
by the supreme power of an act of parliament. But in those
countries which have followed the Roman or civil law, a bastard&rsquo;s
status may be provisional, and he can be made legitimate by
the subsequent marriage of his parents. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Legitimacy and
Legitimation</a></span>; and, for statistics, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Illegitimacy</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">BASTARNAE,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> the easternmost people of the Germanic race,
the first to come into contact with the ancient world and the
Slavs. Originally settled in Galicia and the Bukovina, they
appeared on the lower Danube about 200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and were used by
Philip V. of Macedon against his Thracian neighbours. Defeated
by these the Bastarnae returned north, leaving some of their
number (hence called Peucini) settled on Peuce, an island in the
Danube. Their main body occupied the country between the
eastern Carpathians and the Danube. As allies of Perseus and
of Mithradates the Great, and lastly on their own account, they
had hostile relations with the Romans who in the time of
Augustus defeated them, and made a peace, which was disturbed
by a series of incursions. In these the Bastarnae after a time
gave place to the Goths, with whom they seem to have amalgamated,
and we last hear of them as transferred by the emperor
Probus to the right bank of the Danube. Polybius and the
authors who copy him regard the Bastarnae as Galatae; Strabo,
having learned of the Romans to distinguish Celts and Germans,
first allows a German element; Tacitus expressly declares their
German origin but says that the race was degraded by intermarriage
with Sarmatians. The descriptions of their bodily appearance,
tribal divisions, manner of life and methods of warfare are
such as are applied to either race. No doubt they were an outpost
of the Germans, and so had absorbed into themselves strong
Getic, Celtic and Sarmatian elements.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BASTI,<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> a town and district of British India, in the Gorakhpur
division of the United Provinces. The town, a collection of
villages, is on the river Kuana, 40 m. from Gorakhpur by railway.
The population in 1901 was 14,761. It has no municipality.
The district has an area of 2792 sq. m. It stretches out in one
vast marshy plain, draining towards the south-east, and traversed
by the Rapti, Kuana, Banganga, Masdih, Jamwar, Ami and
Katneihia rivers. The tract lying between these streams
consists of a rich alluvial deposit, more or less subject to
inundations, but producing good crops of rice, wheat and barley. In
1901 the population was 1,846,153, showing an increase of 3%
in the decade. A railway from Gorakhpur to Gonda runs through
the district, and the river Gogra is navigable. A large transit
trade is conducted with Nepal. The export trade of the district
itself is chiefly in rice, sugar and other agricultural produce.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BASTIA,<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> a town and seaport on the eastern coast of the island
of Corsica, 98 m. N.N.E. of Ajaccio by rail. Pop. (1906) 24,509.
Bastia, the chief commercial town in Corsica, consists of the
densely-populated quarter of the old port with its labyrinth of
steep and narrow streets, and of a more modern quarter to the
north, which has grown up round the new port. La Traverse,
a fine boulevard, intersects the town from north to south. Rising
from the sea-shore like an amphitheatre, Bastia presents an
imposing appearance, which is enhanced by the loftiness of its
houses; it has, however, little of architectural interest to offer.
Its churches, of which the largest is San Giovanni Battista, are
florid in decoration, as are the law-court, the theatre and the
hôtel-de-ville. The citadel, which dominates the old port, has a
keep of the 14th century. As capital of an arrondissement,
Bastia is the seat of a tribunal of first instance and a sub-prefect,
while it is also the seat of the military governor of Corsica, of a
court of appeal for the whole island, of a court of assizes, and of
a tribunal and a chamber of commerce, and has a lycée, a branch
of the Bank of France, and a library with between 30,000 and
40,000 volumes. The town has active commerce, especially
with Italy. The new port has 1100 ft. of quayage, served by a
railway, and with a depth alongside of 25 ft. The total number
of vessels entered in 1907 was 721 with a tonnage of 337,551,
of which 203,950 were French. The chief exports are chestnut
extract for tanning, cedrates, citrons, oranges, early vegetables,
fish, copper ore and antimony ore. Imports include coal, grain,
flour and wine. Industry consists chiefly in fishing (sardines, &amp;c.,
and coral), the manufacture of tobacco, oil-distilling, tanning,
and the preparation of preserved citrons and of macaroni and
similar provisions.</p>

<p>Bastia dates from the building of the Genoese fortress or
&ldquo;bastille&rdquo; by Lionello Lomellino in 1383. Under the Genoese it
was long the principal stronghold in the north of the island, and
the residence of the governor; and in 1553 it was the first
town attacked by the French. On the division of the island in
1797 into the two departments of Golo and Liamone, Bastia
remained the capital of the former; but when the two were
again united Ajaccio obtained the superiority. The city was
taken by the English in 1745 and again in 1794.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BASTIAN, ADOLF<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1826-&emsp;&emsp;), German ethnologist, was
born at Bremen on the 26th of June 1826. He was educated as a
physician, but from his early years devoted himself to travel.
Proceeding to Australia in 1851 as surgeon on a vessel, he had
visited almost every part of the world before his return in 1859.
In 1861 he made an expedition to the Far East which lasted five
years. Upon his return he commenced the publication of his
great work on <i>The Peoples of Eastern Asia</i>, an immense storehouse
of facts owing little to arrangement or style. He settled in
Berlin, where he was made professor of ethnology at the university
and keeper of the ethnological museum. He succeeded
R. Virchow as president of the Berlin Anthropological Society,
and to him was largely due the formation in 1878 of the German
Africa Society of Berlin, which did much to encourage German
colonization in Africa. Later he undertook further scientific
travels in Africa, South America and India. The results of
these explorations were made public in a long series of separate
publications comprising several on Buddhism, and on the psychological
problems presented by native superstitions. Bastian also
edited the <i>Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</i> from 1869, in conjunction
with Virchow and Robert von Hartmann. On his seventieth
birthday, 1896 (during which year he started on an expedition
to Malaysia), he was presented with a volume of essays composed
by the most distinguished ethnologists in celebration of the event
and dedicated to him. Among his more important works may
be mentioned:&mdash;<i>Der Mensch in der Geschichte</i> (Leipzig, 1860);
<i>Die Völker des östlichen Asien</i> (Jena, 1866-1871); <i>Ethnologische
Forschungen</i> (Leipzig, 1871-1873); <i>Die Kulturländer des alten
Amerika</i> (Berlin, 1878); <i>Der Buddhismus in seiner Psychologie</i>
(Berlin, 1881); <i>Indonesien</i> (Leipzig, 1884); <i>Der Fetisch an der
Küste Guineas</i> (Berlin, 1885); <i>Die mikronesischen Kolonien</i>
(1899-1900); <i>Die wechselnden Phasen im geschichtlichen Sehkreis
und ihre Rückwirkung auf die Völkerkunde</i> (1900).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BASTIAT, FRÉDÉRIC<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> (1801-1850), French economist, was
the son of a merchant of Bayonne, and was born in that town on
the 29th of June 1801. Educated at the colleges of Saint-Sever
and of Sorèze, he entered in 1818 the counting-house of his
uncle at Bayonne. The practical routine of mercantile life being
distasteful to him, in 1825 he retired to a property at Mugron,
of which he became the owner on the death of his grandfather.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>501</span>
Here Bastiat occupied himself with farming, his leisure being
devoted to study and meditation. He welcomed with enthusiasm
the Revolution of 1830. In 1831 he became a <i>juge de paix</i> of his
canton, and in 1832 a member of the <i>conseil général</i> of the Landes.
In 1834 he published his first pamphlet, and between 1841 and 1844
three others, all on questions of taxation affecting local interests.
During this period an accidental circumstance led him to become
a subscriber to an English newspaper, the <i>Globe and Traveller</i>,
through which he was made acquainted with the nature and
progress of the crusade of the Anti-Corn-Law League against
protection. After studying the movement for two years, he
resolved to inaugurate a similar movement in France. To
prepare the way, he contributed in 1844 to the <i>Journal des
Économistes</i> an article &ldquo;Sur l&rsquo;influence des tarifs anglais et
français,&rdquo; which attracted great attention, and was followed by
others, including the first series of his brilliant <i>Sophismes
Économiques</i>.</p>

<p>In 1845 Bastiat came to Paris in order to superintend the
publication of his <i>Cobden et la Ligue, ou l&rsquo;agitation anglaise pour
la liberté des échanges</i>, and was very cordially received by the
economists of the capital. From Paris he went to London and
Manchester, and made the personal acquaintance of Cobden,
Bright and other leaders of the league. When he returned to
France he found that his writings had been exerting a powerful
influence; and in 1846 he assisted in organizing at Bordeaux the
first French Free-Trade Association (Association pour la Liberté
des Échanges). The rapid spread of the movement soon required
him to abandon Mugron for Paris.</p>

<p>During the eighteen months which followed this change his
labours were prodigious. He acted as secretary of the central
committee of the association, organized and corresponded with
branch societies, waited on ministers, procured subscriptions,
edited a weekly paper, the <i>Libre-Échange</i>, contributed to the
<i>Journal des Économistes</i> and to three other periodicals, addressed
meetings in Paris and the provinces, and delivered a course of
lectures on the principles of political economy to students of the
schools of law and of medicine. The cause to which he thus devoted
himself at the expense of his health and life appeared for a time
as if it would be successful; but the forces in its favour were much
weaker and those opposed to it were much stronger in France than
in England, and this became more apparent as the struggle
proceeded, until it was brought to an abrupt end by the
Revolution of February 1848. This event made the socialistic and
communistic principles, which had been gathering and spreading
during the previous thirty years, temporarily supreme. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">National Workshops</a></span>.) In this grave crisis Bastiat nobly
performed his duty. Although exhausted by the far too heavy
labours in which he had been engaged, although robbed of his
voice by the malady which was preying upon him, so that he
could do but little to defend the truth from the tribune of the
Constituent Assembly, he could still suggest wise counsels in the
committee of finance of which he was vice-president, and he could
still use his pen with a vigour and dexterity which made him
capable of combating single-handed many opponents.</p>

<p>He wrote in rapid succession a series of brilliant and effective
pamphlets and essays, showing how socialism was connected with
protection, and exposing the delusions on which it rested. Thus
within the space of two years there appeared <i>Propriété et Loi,
Justice et Fraternité, Propriété et Spoliation, L&rsquo;État, Baccalauréat
et Socialisme, Protectionisme et Communisme, Capital et Rente,
Maudit Argent, Spoliation et Loi, Gratuité du Credit</i>, and <i>Ce qu&rsquo;on
voit et ce qu&rsquo;on ne voit pas</i>. While thus occupied he was meditating
the composition of a great constructive work, meant to renovate
economical science by basing it on the principle that &ldquo;interests,
left to themselves, tend to harmonious combinations, and to the
progressive preponderance of the general good.&rdquo; The first volume
of this work <i>Les Harmonies économiques</i> was published in the
beginning of 1850. In the autumn of that year, when working on
the second volume, the increase of his malady compelled him to
go to Italy. After lingering at Pisa and Florence he reached
Rome, but only to die there on the 24th of December 1850 in the
fiftieth year of his age.</p>

<p>The life-work of Bastiat, in order to be fairly appreciated,
requires to be considered in three aspects. (1) He was the
advocate of free-trade, the opponent of protection. The general
principles of free-trade had, of course, been clearly stated and
solidly established before he was born, but he did more than
merely restate them. He showed, as no one before him had done,
how they were practically applicable to French agriculture, trade
and commerce; and in the <i>Sophismes Économiques</i> we have the
completest and most effective, the wisest and the wittiest
exposure of protectionism in its principles, reasonings and
consequences which exists in any language. (2) He was the
opponent of socialism. In this respect also he had no equal
among the economists of France. He alone fought socialism hand
to hand, body to body, as it were, not caricaturing it, not denouncing
it, not criticizing under its name some merely abstract theory,
but taking it as actually presented by its most popular representatives,
considering patiently their proposals and arguments, and
proving conclusively that they proceeded on false principles,
reasoned badly and sought to realize generous aims by foolish
and harmful means. Nowhere will reason find a richer armoury
of weapons available against socialism than in the pamphlets
published by Bastiat between 1848 and 1850. (3) He attempted
to expound in an original and independent manner political
economy as a science. In combating, first, the Protectionists,
and, afterwards, the Socialists, there gradually rose on his mind a
conception which seemed to him to shed a flood of light over the
whole of economical doctrine, and, indeed, over the whole theory
of society, viz. the harmony of the essential tendencies of human
nature. The radical error, he became always more convinced,
both of protectionism and socialism, was the assumption that
human interests, if left to themselves would inevitably prove
antagonistic and anti-social, capital robbing labour, manufactures
ruining agriculture, the foreigner injuring the native, the consumer
the producer, &amp;c.; and the chief weakness of the various schools
of political economy, he believed, he had discovered in their
imperfect apprehension of the truth that human interests, when
left to themselves, when not arbitrarily and forcibly interfered
with, tend to harmonious combination, to the general good.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BASTIDE, JULES<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (1800-1879), French publicist, was born at
Paris on the 22nd of November 1800. He studied law for a time,
and afterwards engaged in business as a timber merchant. In
1821 he became a member of the French Carbonari, and took a
prominent part in the Revolution of 1830. After the &ldquo;July
Days&rdquo; he received an artillery command in the national guard.
For his share in the <i>émeute</i> in Paris (5th of June 1832) on the
occasion of the funeral of General Maximilien Lamarque, Bastide
was sentenced to death but escaped to London. On his return
to Paris in 1834 he was acquitted, and occupied himself with
journalism, contributing to the <i>National</i>, a republican journal of
which he became editor in 1836. In 1847 he founded the <i>Revue
nationale</i> with the collaboration of P.J. Buchez (<i>q.v.</i>), with whose
ideas he had become infected. After the Revolution of February
1848 Bastide&rsquo;s intimate knowledge of foreign affairs gained for
him a secretarial post in the provisional government, and, after
the creation of the executive commission, he was made minister
of foreign affairs. At the close of 1848 he threw up his portfolio,
and, after the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of December 1851, retired into private
life. He died on the 2nd of March 1879. His writings comprise
<i>De l&rsquo;éducation publique en France</i> (1847);

They were established by the abbeys, the nobles and the crown,
frequently by two of these authorities in co-operation, and were
intended to serve as defensive posts and centres of population
for sparsely-inhabited districts. In addition, they formed a
source of revenue and power for their founders, who on their
part conceded liberal charters to the new towns. They were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page502" id="page502"></a>502</span>
built on a rectangular plan, with a large central square and
straight thoroughfares running at right angles or parallel to one
another, this uniformity of construction being well exemplified
in the existing <i>bastide</i> of Monpazier (Dordogne) founded by the
English in 1284. Mont-de-Marsan, the oldest of the bastides,
was founded in 1141, and the movement for founding them
lasted during the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries, attaining its
height between 1250 and 1350.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BASTIEN-LEPAGE, JULES<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (1848-1884), French painter, was
born in the village of Damvillers, Meuse, France, on the 1st of
November 1848 and spent his childhood there. He first studied
at Verdun, and prompted by a love of art went in 1867 to Paris,
where he was admitted to the École des Beaux-arts, working
under Cabanel. After exhibiting in the Salons of 1870 and 1872
works which attracted no attention, in 1874 he made his mark
with his &ldquo;Song of Spring,&rdquo; a study of rural life, representing a
peasant girl sitting on a knoll looking down on a village. His
&ldquo;Portrait of my Grandfather,&rdquo; exhibited in the same year, was
not less remarkable for its artless simplicity and received a
third-class medal. This success was confirmed in 1875 by the
&ldquo;First Communion,&rdquo; a picture of a little girl minutely worked
up as to colour, and a &ldquo;Portrait of M. Hayem.&rdquo; In 1875 he
took the second Prix de Rome with his &ldquo;Angels appearing to the
Shepherds,&rdquo; exhibited again in 1878. His next endeavour to
win the Grand Prix de Rome in 1876 with &ldquo;Priam at the Feet of
Achilles&rdquo; was again unsuccessful (it is in the Lille gallery), and
the painter determined to return to country life. To the Salon
of 1877 he sent a full-length &ldquo;Portrait of Lady L.&rdquo; and &ldquo;My
Parents&rdquo;; and in 1878 a &ldquo;Portrait of M. Theuriet&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Hayfield.&rdquo; The last picture, now in the Luxembourg, is regarded
as a typical work from its stamp of realistic truth. Thenceforth
Bastien-Lepage was recognized in France as the leader of a
school, and his &ldquo;Portrait of Mme Sarah Bernhardt&rdquo; (1879),
painted in a light key, won him the cross of the Legion of Honour.
In 1880 he exhibited a small portrait of M. Andrieux and &ldquo;Joan
of Arc listening to the Voices&rdquo;; and in the same year, at the
Royal Academy, the little portrait of the &ldquo;Prince of Wales.&rdquo;
In 1881 he painted &ldquo;The Beggar&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Portrait of Albert
Wolf&rdquo;; in 1882 &ldquo;Le Père Jacques&rdquo;; in 1883 &ldquo;Love in a
Village,&rdquo; in which we find some trace of Courbet&rsquo;s influence.
His last dated work is &ldquo;The Forge&rdquo; (1884). The artist, long
ailing, had tried in vain to re-establish his health in Algiers.
He died in Paris on the 10th of December 1884, when planning a
new series of rural subjects. Among his more important works
may also be mentioned the portrait of &ldquo;Mme J. Drouet&rdquo;
(1883); &ldquo;Gambetta on his death-bed,&rdquo; and some landscapes;
&ldquo;The Vintage&rdquo; (1880), and &ldquo;The Thames at London&rdquo; (1882).
&ldquo;The Little Chimney-Sweep&rdquo; was never finished. An exhibition
of his collected works was opened in March and April 1885.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BASTILLE<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (from Fr. <i>bastir</i>, now <i>bâtir</i>, to build), originally
any fortified building forming part of a system of defence or
attack; the name was especially applied to several of the
principal points in the ancient fortifications of Paris. In the
reign of King John, or even earlier, the gate of Saint Antoine
was flanked by two towers; and about 1369 Hugues Aubriot,
at the command of Charles V., changed it into a regular bastille
or fort by the addition of six others of massive structure, the
whole united by thick walls and surrounded by a ditch 25 ft.
wide. Various extensions and alterations were afterwards
effected; but the building remained substantially what it was
made by the vigorous provost, a strong and gloomy structure,
with eight stern towers. As the ancient fortifications of the city
were superseded, the use of the word bastille as a general designation
gradually died out, and it became restricted to the castle of
Saint Antoine, the political importance of which made it practically,
long before it was actually, the only bastille of Paris.
The building had originally a military purpose, and it appears
as a fortress on several occasions in French history. When
Charles VII. retook Paris from the English in 1436, his opponents
in the city took refuge in the Bastille, which they were prepared
to defend with vigour, but the want of provisions obliged them
to capitulate. In 1588 the duke of Guise took possession of the
Bastille, gave the command of it to Bussy-Leclerc, and soon
afterwards shut up the whole parlement within its walls, for
having refused their adherence to the League. When Henry IV.
became master of Paris he committed the command of the
Bastille to Sully, and there he deposited his treasures, which at
the time of his death amounted to the sum of 15,870,000 livres.
On the 11th of January 1649 the Bastille was invested by the
forces of the Fronde, and after a short cannonade capitulated
on the 13th of that month. The garrison consisted of only
twenty-two men. The Frondeurs concluded a peace with the
court on the 11th of March; but it was stipulated by treaty
that they should retain possession of the Bastille, which in fact
was not restored to the king till the 21st of October 1651.</p>

<p>At a very early period, however, the Bastille was employed
for the custody of state prisoners, and it was ultimately much
more of a prison than a fortress. According to the usual account,
which one is tempted to ascribe to the popular love of poetical
justice, the first who was incarcerated within its walls was the
builder himself, Hugues Aubriot. Be this as it may, the duke
of Nemours spent thirteen years there in one of those iron cages
which Louis XI. called his <i>fillettes</i>; and Jacques d&rsquo;Armagnac,
Poyet and Chabot were successively prisoners. It was not till
the reign of Louis XIII. that it became recognized as a regular
place of confinement; but from that time till its destruction it
was frequently filled to embarrassment with men and women
of every age and condition. Prisoners were detained without
trial on <i>lettres de cachet</i> for different reasons, to avoid a scandal,
either public or private, or to satisfy personal animosities.
But the most frequent and most notorious use of the Bastille
was to imprison those writers who attacked the government or
persons in power. It was this which made it so hated as an
emblem of despotism, and caused its capture and demolition in
the Revolution.</p>

<p>Of the treatment of prisoners in the Bastille very various
accounts have been given even by those who speak from personal
experience, for the simple reason that it varied greatly in different
cases. The prisoners were divided into two main classes, those
who were detained on grounds of precaution or by way of
admonitory correction, and those who lay under presumption
or proof of guilt. The former were subject to no investigation
or judgment, and the length of their imprisonment depended
on the will of the king; the latter were brought to trial in the
ordinary courts or before special tribunals, such as that of the
Arsenal&mdash;though even in their case the interval between their
arrest and their trial was determined solely by the royal decree,
and it was quite possible for a man to grow old in the prison
without having the opportunity of having his fate decided.
Until guilt was established, the prisoner was registered in the
king&rsquo;s name, and&mdash;except in the case of state-prisoners of importance,
who were kept with greater strictness and often in absolute
isolation&mdash;he enjoyed a certain degree of comfort and freedom.
Visitors were admitted under restrictions; games were allowed;
and, for a long time at least, exercise was permitted in open parts
of the interior. Food was both abundant and good, at least for
the better class of prisoners; and instances were not unknown
of people living below their allowance and, by arrangement with
the governor, saving the surplus. When the criminality of the
prisoner was established, his name was transferred to the register
of the &ldquo;commission,&rdquo; and he became exposed to numerous
hardships and even barbarities, which however belonged not so
much to the special organization of the Bastille as to the general
system of criminal justice then in force.</p>

<p>Among the more distinguished personages who were confined
in this fortress during the reigns of Louis XIV., XV. and XVI.,
were the famous <i>Man of the Iron Mask</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Iron Mask</a></span>), Foucquet,
the marshal Richelieu, Le Maistre de Sacy, De Renneville,
Voltaire, Latude, Le Prévôt de Beaumont, Labourdonnais,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page503" id="page503"></a>503</span>
Lally, Cardinal de Rohan, Linguet and La Chalotais. While
no detestation is too great for that system of &ldquo;royal pantheism&rdquo;
which led to the unjust and often protracted imprisonment of
even men of great ability and stainless character, it is unnecessary
to give implicit credence to all the tales of horror which found
currency during the excitement of the Revolution, and which
historical evidence, as well as <i>a priori</i> considerations, tends to
strip of their more dreadful features, and even in many cases to
refute altogether. Much light of an unexpected kind has in
modern times been shed on the history of the Bastille from the
pages of its own records. These documents had been flung out
into the courts of the building by the revolutionary captors, and
after suffering grievous diminution and damage were finally
stored up and forgotten in the vaults of the library of the (so-called)
Arsenal. Here they were discovered in 1840 by François
Ravaisson, who devoted himself to their arrangement, elucidation
and publication.</p>

<p>At the breaking out of the Revolution the Bastille was attacked
by the Parisians; and, after a vigorous resistance, it was taken
and razed to the ground on the 14th of July 1789. At the time
of its capture only seven prisoners were found in it. A very
striking account of the siege will be found in Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>French
Revolution</i>, vol. i. The site of the building is now marked by a
lofty column of bronze, dedicated to the memory of the patriots
of July 1789 and 1830. It is crowned by a gilded figure of the
genius of liberty.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BASTINADO<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (Span. <i>baston</i>, Fr. <i>bâton</i>, a stick, cudgel), the
European name for a form of punishment common in the east,
especially in Turkey, Persia and China. It consists in blows
with a light stick or lath of bamboo upon the soles of the feet or
on the buttocks. The terror of the punishment lies not in the
severity of the blows, which are on the contrary scarcely more
than tapping, but in its long continuation. A skilful bastinadoist
can kill his victim after hours of torture.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BASTION<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> (through the Fr. from late Lat. <i>bastire</i>, to build), a
work forming part of a line of fortifications. The general trace
of a bastion is similar to an irregular pentagon formed by a
triangle and a narrow rectangle, the base of the triangle coinciding
with the long side of the rectangle. The two sides of the
triangle form the &ldquo;faces&rdquo; of the bastion, which join at the
&ldquo;salient&rdquo; angle, the short sides of the rectangle form the
&ldquo;flanks.&rdquo; Bastions were arranged so that the fire from the flanks
of each protected not only the front of the curtain but also the
faces of the adjacent bastions. A &ldquo;tower bastion&rdquo; is a case-mated
tower built in bastion form; a &ldquo;demi-bastion&rdquo; is a work
formed by half a bastion (bisected through the salient angle) and
by a parapet along the line of bisection; a &ldquo;flat bastion&rdquo; is a
bastion built on a curtain and having a very obtuse salient angle.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BASTWICK, JOHN<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (1593-1654), English physician and
religious zealot, was born at Writtle, in Essex, in 1593, and after
a brief education at Cambridge, wandered on the continent and
graduated in medicine at Padua. On his return he settled in
Colchester. His celebrity rests on his strong opposition to the
Roman Catholic ceremonial. About 1633 he printed in Holland
two Latin treatises, entitled <i>Elenchus Religionis Papisticae</i>, and
<i>Flagellum Pontificis et Episcoporum Latialium</i>; and as Laud
and other English prelates thought themselves aimed at, he was
fined £1000 in the court of high commission, excommunicated
and prohibited from practising physic, while his books were
ordered to be burnt and the author himself consigned to prison.
Instead of recanting, however, he wrote <i>Apologeticus ad Praesules
Anglicanos</i>, and another book called <i>The Litany</i>, in which he
exclaimed vehemently against the proceedings of the court, and
charged the bishops with being the enemies of God and &ldquo;the tail
of the beast.&rdquo; William Prynne and Henry Burton coming under
the lash of the star-chamber court at the same time, they were all
censured as turbulent and seditious persons, and condemned to
pay a fine of £5000 each, to be set in the pillory, to lose their ears,
and to undergo imprisonment for life in remote parts of the
kingdom, Bastwick being sent to Scilly. The parliament in 1640
reversed these proceedings, and ordered Bastwick a reparation
of £5000 out of the estates of the commissioners and lords who
had sentenced him. He joined the parliamentary army, but in
later years showed bitter opposition to the Independents. He
died in the latter part of 1654.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BASUTOLAND<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (officially &ldquo;The Territory of Basutoland&rdquo;),
an inland state and British crown colony of S.E. Africa, situated
between 28° 35&prime; and 30° 30&prime; S. and 27° and 29° 25&prime; E. It has an
area of 10,293 sq. m., being somewhat smaller than Belgium, and
is bounded S., S.E., and N.E. by the Drakensberg, N. and N.W.
by the Caledon river, S.W. by a range of low hills extending from
the Caledon above Wepener to the Orange river, and south of the
Orange by the Telle or Tees river to its source in the Drakensberg.
Its greatest length S.W. to N.E. is 145 m.; its greatest breadth
N. to S. 120 m. On every side it is surrounded by British colonies,
north by the Orange River Colony, south-west and south by
Cape Colony, and east by Natal.</p>

<p>Basutoland, or Lesuto (Lesotho) as the natives call it, forms
the south-eastern edge of the interior tableland of South Africa,
and has a rugged and broken surface with a mean elevation of
6000 ft. The Drakensberg (<i>q.v.</i>) forming the buttress of the
plateau seaward, attain their highest elevation on the Basuto-Natal
border. The frontier line follows the crest of the mountains,
three peaks some 10,000 or more ft. high&mdash;Giant&rsquo;s Castle,
Champagne Castle or Cathkin Peak and Mont aux Sources&mdash;towering
high above the general level. Mount Hamilton, which
lies north of the waterparting, is over 9000 ft. high. From
Mont aux Sources, table-shaped, and called by the Basutos
<i>Potong</i> (Antelope), a second range of mountains, the Maluti,
runs S.W. through the entire length of Basutoland. The crest of
the Maluti is in few places lower than 7000 ft. whilst Machacha,
the culminating point, is about 10,500 ft. From the tableland
north of the Maluti several isolated hills rise, the most noted being
the almost inaccessible Thaba Bosigo&mdash;the rallying place of the
Basuto in many of their wars. Shut off from the adjacent
Indian Ocean by its mountain barrier, the drainage of the country
is westward to the distant Atlantic. As its name implies, the
chief rivers rise in Mont aux Sources. From the inner sides of
that mountain descend the Caledon and the Senku, whilst from
its seaward face the Tugela flows through Natal to the Indian
Ocean. The Caledon runs north of the Maluti, the Senku south
of that range. From the slopes of the Maluti descend many
streams, the largest being the Kornet Spruit, which joins the
Senku and other torrents from the Drakensberg to form the upper
Orange (<i>q.v.</i>). The Caledon also, sweeping southward, unites
with the Orange beyond the frontiers of Basutoland. Ordinarily
shallow, the rivers after heavy rain fill with great rapidity,
sweeping away everything in their path. In the richer soil they
cut deep channels; the denudation thus caused threatens to
diminish seriously the area of arable and pasture land. The
river beds contain dangerous quicksands.</p>

<p>The aspect of the country is everywhere grand, and often
beautiful, fully justifying the title, &ldquo;The Switzerland of South
Africa,&rdquo; often applied to it. Viewed from a distance the
mountains appear as dark perpendicular barriers, quite impenetrable;
but narrow paths lead round the precipitous face of the
hills, and when the inner side is gained a wonderful panorama
opens out. In every direction can be seen luxuriant valleys
through which rivers thread their silvery way, wild chasms,
magnificent waterfalls&mdash;that of Maletsunyane has an unbroken
leap of over 600 ft.&mdash;and, above all, hill crest after hill crest in
seeming endless succession. In winter the effect is heightened
by the snow which caps all the higher peaks.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;Basutoland is entirely occupied by the upper division
(Stormberg series) of the Karroo formation. The highest
strata (Volcanic group) form the rugged elevated spurs of the
Drakensberg mountains which extend along the eastern territorial
boundary. It has been suggested that these spurs represent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id="page504"></a>504</span>
the sites of vents or fissures of eruption. The upper part of
the Maluti range consists of flows of melaphyres and diabases
belonging to the volcanic beds. Among these lavas is the &ldquo;pipe&rdquo;
amygdaloid of which many blocks have been transported great
distances down the Vaal river. The amygdales are three or four
inches long and about three-eighths of an inch in diameter.
Heulandite, with thomsonite, stilbite, scolecite, calcite and
chalcedony, occur as infilling minerals.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate is excellent, invigorating alike for
Europeans and natives. The mean annual temperature is about
60° F. The four seasons are distinctly marked, a rarity in South
Africa, where the transition from summer to winter is generally
very rapid. The heat of summer (December-March, which is
the rainy season) is tempered by cool breezes; winter (May-September,
inclusive) is dry, cold and bracing, and frost prevails
for prolonged periods. The average annual rainfall is about 30 in.
The general health conditions are good. Malaria is almost
unknown and chest complaints are rare. Epidemics of smallpox
and typhoid occur; and leprosy, imported from the Orange
River and Cape Colonies, has taken firm hold on the Basuto, of
whom about 91 per 1000 are sufferers from this disease.</p>

<p><i>Flora and Fauna.</i>&mdash;A few kloofs are wooded, but of forest land
there is none. Along the upper courses of the rivers are willows
and wild olive trees; round the chief settlements the eucalyptus
and the pine have been planted. Heaths, generally somewhat
rare in South Africa outside the Cape peninsula, are abundant
in Basutoland. The Alpine flora is very beautiful. There are
few wild animals; but the eland, hartebeest and smaller antelopes
are found, as well as the leopard and the jackal. Mountain hares,
partridges and quails afford good sport; baboons and great
hawks live in the mountains. The few fish include the barbel.
Swarms of locusts occasionally visit the country; the locusts are
eaten by the Basuto.</p>

<p><i>Population and Towns.</i>&mdash;Considering the extensive area of
uninhabitable mountain land it contains, the Territory supports
a large population. The inhabitants increased from 128,206 in
1875 to 348,848 in 1904. The females outnumber the males by
about 20,000, which is, however, about the number of adult males
away from the country at any given period. The majority live
in the district between the Maluti mountains and the Caledon
river. The great bulk of the people are Basuto, but there are
some thousands of Barolong and other Kaffirs. The Basuto
proper are a branch of the Bechuana family of Bantu-Negroids.
The white inhabitants in 1904 numbered 895, and there were
222 coloured persons other than natives. The seat of government
is Maseru, on the left bank of the Caledon, with a population of
about 1000 including some 100 Europeans. Mafeteng, in the
N.W. near the Cape frontier, is a thriving agricultural centre, as
is Butha Buthe in the N.E.  Morija, some 16 m. S.E. of Maseru,
is the oldest mission station in the Territory, having been founded
by the Paris Society about 1833. Three miles from Morija is
Matsieng, the kraal of the paramount chief Lerothodi (who
died in August 1905). There are numerous mission stations
throughout Basutoland, to several of which Biblical names have
been given, such as Shiloh, Hermon, Cana, Bethesda, Berea.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture and Trade.</i>&mdash;Basutoland is one of the greatest
grain-growing countries of South Africa. The richest tract of
land is that between the Maluti mountains and the Caledon
river. In summer the country appears as one waving field of
wheat, millet and mealies; whilst on the mountain slopes and
on their flat tops are large flocks of sheep, cattle and goats, and
troops of ponies. The Basuto ponies, said to be descended from
Shetland ponies which, imported to the Cape in 1840, strayed
into the mountains, are short-legged, strong-bodied, sure-footed,
and noted for their hardiness. Improvements in the breed have
been effected by the introduction of Arab stallions. Nearly
every Basuto is an agriculturist; there are no manufactories,
and the minerals, in accordance with the desire of the people,
are not worked. The land is wholly in the possession of the
natives, who hold it on the communal system. Whites and
Indians are allowed to establish trading stations on obtaining
special permits from the government, and the Indians absorb
much of the retail trade. The chief exports are wheat, mealies,
Kaffir corn, wool, mohair, horses and cattle. The great bulk of
the imports are textiles. The value of the trade depends on
regular rains, so that in seasons of drought the exports seriously
diminish. The average annual value of trade for the five years
ending the 30th of June 1905 was:&mdash;Exports £215,668, imports
£203,026. Trade is almost entirely with Orange River Colony
and Cape Colony. The Territory is a member of the South
African Customs Union. Some 60,000 Basuto (annual average)
find employment outside the Territory, more than half of whom
seek farm and domestic service. A small proportion go to the
Johannesburg gold mines, and others obtain employment on the
railways.</p>

<p>Communication over the greater part of the Territory is by
road; none of the rivers is navigable. A state-owned railway,
16½ m. long, starting from Maseru crosses the Caledon river and
joins the line connecting Bloemfontein and Ladysmith. This
railway follows, N.E. of Maseru, the right bank of the Caledon,
and affords a ready means of transport for the cereals raised on
the left or Basuto side of the river. Highroads, maintained by
the government, traverse every part of the country, and bridges
have been built across the Caledon. The usual mode of conveyance
is by ox-waggon or light cart. Several passes through the
Drakensberg into Griqualand East and Natal exist, but are little
used. There is a complete postal and telegraphic service and a
telephone line connects all government stations.</p>

<p><i>Government and Finance.</i>&mdash;Basutoland is a crown colony, of
which the high commissioner for South Africa is governor. In
him resides the legislative power, exercised by proclamation.
The Territory is administered, under the direction of the
governor, by a resident commissioner, who is also the chief
judicial officer. He is aided by a government secretary and by
assistant commissioners. Under the British officials the country
is governed by hereditary native chiefs, over whom is a paramount
chief. The chiefs have jurisdiction in cases affecting
natives, but there is a right of appeal to the courts of the commissioners,
who try all cases in which any of the parties are
European. A national council (<i>pitso</i>), representative of all the
native tribes, meets annually for the free discussion of public
affairs. For administrative purposes the Territory is divided
into the seven districts of Maseru, Leribe, Mohales Hoek, Berea,
Mafeteng, Quthing and Qacha&rsquo;s Nek, each of which is subdivided
into wards presided over by Basuto chiefs.</p>

<p>Revenue is obtained from a hut tax of £1 per hut; the
sale of licences to trade; customs and post office receipts.
Seven-eighths of the revenue comes from the hut tax and
customs. The average annual revenue for the five years 1901-1905
was £96,880; the average annual expenditure £69,559.
Basutoland has no public debt.</p>

<p><i>Education and Social Condition.</i>&mdash;Education is given in schools
founded by missionary societies, of which the chief is the Société
des Missions Évangéliques de Paris. A large proportion of the
people can read and write Sesuto (as the Basuto language is
called) and English, and speak Dutch, whilst a considerable
number also receive higher education. Many Basuto at the
public examinations take higher honours than competitors of
European descent. There are over 200 schools, with an average
attendance exceeding 10,000. Nine-tenths of the scholars are in
the schools of the French Protestant Mission, which are conducted
by English, or English-speaking, missionaries. A government
grant is made towards the cost of upkeep. A government industrial
school (opened in 1906) is maintained at Maseru, and
the Paris Society has an industrial school at Leloaleng. The
social condition of the people is higher than that of the majority
of South African natives. Many Basuto profess Christianity
and have adopted European clothing. Serious crime is rare
among them and &ldquo;deliberate murder is almost unknown.&rdquo;<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
They are, like mountaineers generally, of a sturdy, independent
spirit, and are given to the free expression of their views, generally
stated with good sense and moderation. These views found
a new medium of publicity in 1904 when an independent native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id="page505"></a>505</span>
newspaper was started, called <i>Naledi ea Lesotha</i> (Star of Basutoland).
The publication of this paper was followed in 1906 by
the adoption of a uniform system of Sesuto orthography. A
book on national customs, the first work in the vernacular by
a South African native, was published in 1893. The brandy-drinking
habit, which, when the imperial government assumed
control of the administration in 1884, threatened the existence
of the nation, has been very largely checked. A strong beer,
brewed from Kaffir corn, is a favourite drink.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Until the beginning of the 19th century Basutoland
appears to have been uninhabited save by wandering Bushmen,
whose rude rock pictures are to be found in several parts of the
Drakensberg. About 1800 the country was occupied by various
tribes of Bechuana, such as Batau, Basuto, Baputi, who then
possessed the greater part of what is now Orange River Colony.
They appear to have recognized the paramount authority of a
family descended from a chief named Monaheng. By the wars
of the Zulu chiefs Chaka, Matiwana and Mosilikatze, these
tribes were largely broken up and their power destroyed. One
tribe, living in the Maluti mountains, was reduced to cannibalism.
<span class="sidenote">Moshesh forms the Basuto nation.</span>
From their chief Machacha mountain takes its name.
At this period a young man named Moshesh (born
about 1790), who was of the family of Monaheng and
already noted as hunter and warrior, gathered round
him the remnants of several broken clans, out of which he
welded the existing Basuto nation. He established himself in
1824 on the rock-fortress of Thaba Bosigo, where, in 1831, he
successfully defended himself against Mosilikatze; and thereafter
became second only to that chief among the natives north
of the Orange River. In 1833 Moshesh invited the missionaries
of the Société des Missions Evangéliques of Paris to settle in his
country, and from that day until his death proved their firm
friend. A few years later, in 1836-1837, large parties of emigrant
Boers settled north of the Orange, and before long disputes arose
between them and Moshesh, who claimed a great part of the land
on which the white farmers had settled. The Basuto acquired
an unenviable notoriety as a race of bold cattle lifters and
raiders, and the emigrant Boers found them extremely troublesome
neighbours. At the same time, if the Basuto were eager
for cattle, the Boers were eager for land; and their encroachments
on the territories of the Basuto led to a proclamation in
1842 from Sir George Napier, the then governor of Cape Colony,
forbidding further encroachments on Basutoland. In 1843 a
treaty was signed with Moshesh on the lines of that already
arranged with Waterboer, the Griqua chief (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Griqualand</a></span>),
creating Basutoland a native state under British protection.</p>

<p>To the quarrels between Basuto and Boers were added interminable
disputes between the Basuto and other Bechuana tribes,
which continued unabated after the proclamation of British
sovereignty over the Orange river regions by Sir Harry Smith in
1848. In 1849, however, Moshesh was unwillingly induced by Sir
Harry to surrender his claims to part of the territory recognized
as his by the Napier treaty. The British continued to intervene
in the inter-tribal disputes, and in 1851 Major H.D. Warden led
against the Basuto a commando composed of British soldiers,
farmers and a native contingent. This commando was defeated
at Viervoet, near Thaba Nchu, by the Basuto, who thereafter
raided and plundered the natives opposed to them and the farmers
who had helped the British. Attempts were made to come to
terms with Moshesh and the justice of many of his complaints was
admitted. The efforts at accommodation failed, and in 1852
General Sir George Cathcart, who had succeeded Sir Harry Smith
as governor of Cape Colony, decided to take strong measures with
the tribe, and proceeded with three small divisions of troops
against Moshesh. The expedition was by no means a success,
but Moshesh, with that peculiar statecraft for which he was
famous, saw that he could not hope permanently to hold out
against the British troops, and followed up his successful skirmishes
with General Cathcart by writing him a letter, in which
he said: &ldquo;As the object for which you have come is to have a
compensation for Boers, I beg you will be satisfied with what you
have taken. You have shown your power, you have chastised;
I will try all I can to keep my people in order in the future.&rdquo;
General Cathcart accepted the offer of Moshesh and peace was
proclaimed, the Basuto power being unbroken. Fourteen months
later (February 1854) Great Britain renounced sovereignty
over the farmers settled beyond the Orange, and Moshesh found
himself face to face with the newly constituted Free State.
Boundary disputes at once arose but were settled (1858) by the
mediation of Sir George Grey, governor of Cape Colony. In 1865
a fresh feud occurred between the Orange Free State Boers and
the Basuto. The latter applied to Sir Philip Wodehouse at the
Cape for protection, but he declined to interfere. The Boers
proved more successful than they had been in the past, and
occupied several of the Basuto strongholds. They also annexed
a certain fertile portion of Basuto territory, and finally terminated
the strife by a treaty at Thaba Bosigo, by which Moshesh gave up
the tract of territory taken by the Boers and professed himself a
subject of the Free State. Seeing that the struggle against the
Boers was hopeless, no fewer than 2000 Basuto warriors having
been killed, Moshesh again appealed for protection to the British
authorities, saying: &ldquo;Let me and my people rest and live under
the large folds of the flag of England before I am no more.&rdquo; In
response to this request, the British authorities decided to take
over Basutoland, and a proclamation of annexation was issued on
the 12th of March 1868. At the same time the Boer commandoes
were requested to leave the country. The Free State strongly
<span class="sidenote">Annexation to Great Britain.</span>
resented the British annexation of Basutoland, but
much negotiation the treaty of Aliwal North was
concluded (1869) between the Free State and the high
commissioner. This treaty defined the boundary
between the Free State and Basutoland, whereby the fertile strip of
country west of the Caledon river, known as the Conquered
Territory, was finally transferred to the Free State, and the
remainder of Basutoland was recognized as a portion of the
British dominions.</p>

<p>Moshesh, who for nearly fifty years had led his people so skilfully
and well, died in 1870. He was one of the rare instances
among the Kaffirs of a leader endowed with intellectual gifts
which placed him on a level with Europeans, and his life-work has
left a permanent mark on South African history. In diplomacy
he proved fully the equal of all&mdash;white or black&mdash;with whom he
had to deal, while he ruled with a rare combination of vigour
and moderation over the nation which he had created.</p>

<p>In 1871 Basutoland was annexed to Cape Colony, the area at
that time being given as 10,300 sq. m. The turbulent Basuto
warriors did not remain quiet for any length of time, and in 1879
Moirosi, a chief residing in the southern portion of Basutoland,
openly repudiated colonial rule. An expedition was despatched
from Cape Colony and severe fighting followed. Moirosi&rsquo;s
stronghold was captured and the chief himself was killed.
Immediately after the war, strife occurred among the Basuto
themselves over the question of the partition of Moirosi&rsquo;s territory,
which had been decided on as one of the results of the war. In
1880 the Cape government felt sufficiently strong to extend to
Basutoland the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878. This act
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;gun&rdquo; war.</span>
provided for the disarmament of natives, and had
already been put in force successfully among some
of the Kaffir tribes on the Cape eastern frontier. Its
execution in Basutoland, however, proved an extremely difficult
task, and was never entirely accomplished. Desultory warfare
was carried on between the colonial troops and the Basuto until
1881, when the intervention of the high commissioner, Sir
Hercules Robinson (afterward Lord Rosmead), was asked for.
Peace in Basutoland was not announced until the end of 1882.
In the following year a form of self-government was established,
but was once more followed by internal strife among the petty
chieftains.</p>

<p>The subjection of Basutoland to the control of the Cape government
had by this time proved unsatisfactory, both to the Basuto
and to Cape Colony. The Cape government therefore offered no
opposition to the appeal made by the Basuto themselves to the
imperial government to take them over, and, moreover, Cape
Colony undertook to pay towards the cost of administration an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page506" id="page506"></a>506</span>
annual contribution of £18,000. Consequently, in 1884, Basutoland
ceased to be a portion of the Cape Colony and became a
British crown colony. Native laws and customs were interfered
with as little as possible and the authority of the chiefs&mdash;all
members of the Moshesh family&mdash;was maintained. Moshesh had
been succeeded as paramount chief by his son, Letsie, and he in
turn was succeeded in 1891 by Lerothodi (<i>c.</i> 1837-1905). These
chieftains acted in concert with the British representative in the
country, to whom was given the title of resident commissioner.
The first commissioner was Sir Marshall Clarke, to whose tact and
ability the country owed much. The period of warfare over, the
Basuto turned their attention more and more to agricultural
pursuits and also showed themselves very receptive of missionary
influence. Trade increased, and in 1891 Basutoland was admitted
to the customs union, which already existed between Orange
Free State, Cape Colony and British Bechuanaland. When
Lord (then Sir Alfred) Milner visited Basutoland in 1898, on his
way to Bloemfontein, he was received by 15,000 mounted
Basuto. The chiefs also attended a large meeting at Maseru,
and gave expression to their gratitude for the beneficent
character of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s rule and protection. On the outbreak
of the Boer War in 1899, these same chiefs, at a great meeting
held in the presence of the resident commissioner, gave a further
protestation of their loyalty to Her Majesty. They remained
passive throughout the War and the neutrality of the country was
respected by both armies. One chief alone sought to take advantage
of the situation by disloyal action, and his offence was met
<span class="sidenote">A crown colony.</span>
by a year&rsquo;s imprisonment. The conversion of Basutoland
into a crown colony contributed alike to the prosperity
of the Basuto, the security of the property of neighbouring
colonists and a peaceful condition among the natives of
South Africa generally. In pursuance of the policy of encouraging
the self-governing powers of the Basuto, a national council
was instituted and held its first sitting in July 1903. In August
1905 the paramount chief Lerothodi died. In early life he had
distinguished himself in the wars with the Boers, and in 1880 he
took an active part in the revolt against the Cape government.
Since 1884 he had been a loyal supporter of the imperial authorities,
being unwavering in his adherence in critical times. Fearless
and masterful he also possessed high diplomatic gifts, and though
on occasion arbitrary and passionate he was neither revengeful nor
cruel. On the 19th of September following Lerothodi&rsquo;s death,
the national council, with the concurrence of the imperial government,
elected his son Letsie as paramount chief. The completion
in October 1905 of a railway putting Maseru in connexion with
the South African railway system proved a great boon to the
community. During the rebellion of the natives in Natal and
Zululand in 1906 the Basuto remained perfectly quiet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAT,<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span><a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> a name for any member of the zoological order Chiroptera
(<i>q.v.</i>). Bats are insectivorous animals modified for flight,
with slight powers of progression on the ground; the patagium
or &ldquo;flying-membrane&rdquo; of some squirrels and of <i>Galeopithecus</i>
(<i>q.v.</i>) probably indicates the way in which the modification was
effected. They are distributed throughout the world, but are
most abundant in the tropics and the warmer parts of the
temperate zones; within these limits the largest forms occur.
There is great variation in size; the Malay &ldquo;flying-fox&rdquo;
(<i>Pteropus edulis</i>) measures about a foot in the head and body,
and has a wing-spread of 5 ft.; while in the smaller forms the
head and body may be only about 2 in., and the wing-spread
no more than a foot. The coloration is generally sombre, but
to this there are exceptions; the fruit-bats are brownish yellow
or russet on the under surface; two South American species are
white; Blainville&rsquo;s chin-leafed bat is bright orange; and the
Indian painted bat (<i>Cerivoula picta</i>) with its deep orange dress,
spotted with black on the wing-membranes, has reminded
observers of a large butterfly. In habits bats are social,
nocturnal and crepuscular; the insect-eating species feed on the
wing, in winter in the temperate regions they migrate to a
warmer climate, or hibernate, as do the British bats. The
sense-organs are highly developed; the wing-membranes are
exceedingly sensitive; the nose-leaf is also an organ of perception,
and the external ear is specially modified to receive sound-waves.
Most bats are insect-eaters, but the tropical &ldquo;flying
foxes&rdquo; or fox-bats of the Old World live on fruit; some are
blood-suckers, and two feed on small fish. Twelve species are
British, among which are the pipistrelle (<i>Pipistrellus pygmaeus</i>,
or <i>P. pipistrellus</i>), the long-eared bat (<i>Plecotus auritus</i>), the
noctule (<i>Pipistrellus</i> [<i>Pterygistes</i>] <i>noctulus</i>) the greater and
lesser horseshoe bats (<i>Rhinolophus ferrum-equinum</i> and <i>R.
hipposiderus</i>), &amp;c. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Flying-fox</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vampire</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATAC,<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> a town of the province of Ilocos Norte, Luzon,
Philippine Islands, 10 m. S. of Laoag, the capital. Pop. (1903)
19,524; subsequently, in October 1903, the town of Banna
(pop. 4015) was annexed. Cacao, tobacco, cotton, rice and
indigo are grown in the neighbouring country, and the town
has a considerable trade in these and other commodities; it
also manufactures sugar, fans and woven fabrics. Batac was
founded in 1587. It is the birthplace and home of Archbishop
Gregorio Aglipay (b. 1860), the founder of an important sect of
Filipino Independent Catholics.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATALA,<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> a town of British India, in the Gurdaspur district of
the Punjab, with a station on a branch of the North-Western
railway, 24 m. from Amritsar. Pop. (1901) 27,365. It is an
important centre of trade, with manufactures of cotton and silk
goods, shawls, brass-ware, soap and leather. There are two
mission schools.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATALHA<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> (<i>i.e.</i> battle), a town of Portugal, in the district of
Leiria, formerly included in the province of Estremadura; 8 m.
S. of Leiria. Pop. (1900) 3858. Batalha, which occupies the
site of the medieval Canoeira, is chiefly interesting for its great
Dominican monastery of Santa Maria da Victoria (&ldquo;St Mary of
the Victory&rdquo;), also known as Batalha. Both town and monastery
owe their names to the battle fought on the plain between
Canoeira and Aljubarrota, 9 m. S. W., in which John I. of Portugal
defeated John I. of Castile in 1385 and secured the independence
of his kingdom. The monastery is built of golden-brown limestone,
resembling marble, and richly sculptured. In size and
beauty it excels all the other buildings of Portugal in which
Gothic and Moorish architecture are combined. Its ground-plan
may be roughly described as a parallelogram, measuring
about 500 ft. from north to south, and 445 from east to west;
with the circular annexe of the royal mausoleum on the east,
and the Founder&rsquo;s chapel at the south-western corner. In the
centre is the royal cloister, which is flanked by the refectory,
now a museum, on the west; and by the chapter-house, on the
east. Two smaller cloisters, named respectively after Alphonso
V. and John III., form the northern division of the parallelogram;
its southern division is the Gothic church. The Founder&rsquo;s
chapel contains the tomb of John I. (d. 1433) and Philippa of
Lancaster (d. 1416), his queen, with the tomb of Prince Henry
the Navigator (d. 1460). Like the royal mausoleum, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id="page507"></a>507</span>
several later monarchs are buried, it is remarkable for the
intricacy and exquisite finish of its carved stonework. The
monastery was probably founded in 1388. Plans and masons
were procured from England by Queen Philippa, and the work
was entrusted to A. Domingues, a native architect, and Huetor
Houguet, an Irishman. Only the royal cloister, church and
Founder&rsquo;s chapel were included in the original design; and all
three show signs of English influence. Various additions were
made up to 1551, beginning with the royal mausoleum and ending
with the cloister of John III. Considerable damage was inflicted
by the earthquake of 1755; and in 1810 the monastery was
sacked by the French. It was secularized in 1834 and declared
a national monument in 1840. Thenceforward it was gradually
restored.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATANGAS,<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> a town, port of entry, and the capital of the
province of Batangas, Luzon, Philippine Islands, near the
Batangas river, about 1 m. from its mouth on the E. coast of
the Gulf of Batangas, and about 65 m. S. by E. of Manila. Pop.
(1903) 33,131. The United States government has established
a military post here, and the town has numerous fine public
buildings and private residences. It is the most important port
of a province noted for the fertility of its soil and the industry of
its inhabitants. Its exports, which are large, include rice, coffee
of excellent quality, cacao, sugar, Indian corn, horses and cattle.
The horses of Batangas are unusually strong and active. Cotton
is produced, and is woven into fabrics by the women. The
language is Tagalog.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATARNAY, IMBERT DE<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (? 1438-1523), French statesman,
was born of an old but obscure family in Dauphiné, about the
year 1438. In consequence of a chance circumstance he entered
into relations with the dauphin Louis, at that time (1455) in
arms against the king his father; he attached himself to the
prince, and followed him on his retreat into Burgundy. From
the beginning of his reign Louis XI. loaded Batarnay with
favours: he married him to a rich heiress, Georgette de Montchenu,
lady of Le Bouchage; besides making him captain of
Mont Saint Michel and giving him valuable estates, with, later,
the titles of counsellor and chamberlain to the king. In 1469
Batarnay was sent to keep watch upon the duke of Guienne&rsquo;s
intrigues, which began to appear dangerous. As lieutenant-general
in Roussillon in 1475 he protected the countryside
against the wrath of the king, who wished to repress with cruel
severity a rebellion of the inhabitants. He was present at the
interview between Louis XI. and Edward IV. of England at
Picquigny, and was afterwards employed on negotiations with
the duke of Burgundy. In accordance with the recommendations
of his father, Charles VIII. kept the lord of Le Bouchage
in his confidential service. During the differences that arose in
1485 between the regent, Anne of Beaujeu, and the dukes of
Orleans, Brittany and Alençon, Imbert de Batarnay kept the
inhabitants of Orleans faithful to the king. He proved his skill
in the negotiations concerning the marquisate of Saluzzo and
the town of Genoa. During the Naples expedition he was in
charge of the dauphin, Charles Orland, who died in 1495. He
treated with Maximilian of Austria to prevent him from entering
Picardy during the war with Naples, and then proceeded to
Castile to claim promised support. Under Louis XII. he took
part in the expedition against the Genoese republic in 1507.
Francis I. employed him to negotiate the proposed marriage of
Charles of Austria with Renée of France, daughter of Louis XII.,
and appointed him governor to the dauphin Francis in 1518.
He died on the 12th of May 1523.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATAVIA,<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> a residency of the island of Java, Dutch East
Indies, bounded E., S. and W. by the residencies of Krawana,
Preanger and Bantam, and N. by the Java Sea. It also comprises
a number of small islands in the Java Sea, including the
Thousand Islands group, with a total area of 24 sq. m. The
population in 1898 was 1,313,383, including 12,434 Europeans,
82,510 Chinese, 3426 Arabs and other Asiatic foreigners. The
natives belong to a Sundanese group, but in the north contain
a large admixture of Malays. The northern half of the province
is flat, and even marshy along the coast, and consists of a broad
band of alluvium formed by the series of parallel rivers descending
from the south. The southern half on the other hand is
covered by a mountain range whose chief peaks are situated
along the southern border, namely Halimun mountain, the
volcanoes Salak, Pangerango and Gede, and the Megamendung.
The soil is fertile, and whereas rice is mainly grown on the lowlands
the highlands are especially suitable for the cultivation
of coffee, tea, tobacco, cinchona and vanilla. Extensive cocoanut
plantations are also found in the plains, and market-gardening
is practised in the neighbourhood of the towns. Sugar was
formerly cultivated. The government of the residency of
Batavia differs from that of the other residencies in having no
native regencies, the lands being privately owned. The divisions
of the residency are Batavia, town and surroundings, Tangerang,
Meester Cornelis and Buitenzorg, the first being directly governed
by a resident and the remainder by assistant residents. As
early as the second half of the 17th century the Dutch East
India Company began the practice of selling portions of the land
to private persons, and of granting other portions as the reward
of good services. A large strip of hill-country, almost corresponding
to the present southern or Buitenzorg division of the
residency, was appropriated by the governor-general in 1745
and attached to that office. In 1808, however, Marshal Daendels
disposed of this property to various purchasers, including the
Dutch government, and thus the whole of the residency gradually
passed into private hands. Hence the administration of the
residency is largely confined to police duties. The principal
towns are Batavia (<i>q.v.</i>), which is the capital of the residency,
as well as the seat of government of the whole Dutch East
Indies, Meester Cornelis, Tangerang, Bekasi and Buitenzorg
(<i>q.v.</i>). Tangerang and Bekasi are important centres of trade.
The Buitenzorg hill-country is much visited on account of its
beauty, and cool and healthy climate. Gadok is a health resort
6 m. south-east of Buitenzorg.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATAVIA,<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> a city and seaport on the north coast of the island
of Java, and the capital of all the Dutch settlements in the East.
The population in 1880 was 96,957; in 1898, 115,567; including
9423 Europeans, 26,433 Chinese, 2828 Arabs and 132 other
Asiatic foreigners. It is situated on both sides of the river
Jacatra or Jilivong, in a swampy plain at the head of a capacious
bay. The streets are for the most part straight and regular,
and many of them have a breadth of from 100 to 200 ft. In
several cases there is a canal in the centre lined with stone, and
protected by low parapets or banks, while almost every street
and square is fringed with trees. The old town has greatly
changed from its condition in the 18th century. It was then
surrounded by strong fortifications, and contained a number of
important buildings, such as the town-house (built in 1652 and
restored in 1706), the exchange, the infirmary and orphan
asylum, and the European churches. But the ramparts were
long ago demolished; only natives, Malays, Arabs and Chinese
live here, and the great European houses have either fallen into
decay or been converted into magazines and warehouses. The
European inhabitants live principally in the new town, which
was gradually formed by the integration of Weltevreden (<i>Well-content</i>),
Molenvliet (<i>Mill-stream</i>), Rijswijk (<i>Rice-town</i>), Noordwijk
(<i>North-town</i>), Koningsplein (<i>King&rsquo;s square</i>), and other
suburban villages or stations. The situation of this modern part
is higher and healthier. The imitation of Dutch arrangements
has been avoided, and the natural advantages of the situation and
climate have been turned to account. The houses, generally of a
single storey or two at most, are frequently separated from each
other by rows of trees. Batavia contains numerous buildings
connected with the civil and military organisation of the government.
The governor-general&rsquo;s palace and the government buildings
are the most important of these; in the district of Weltevreden
are also the barracks, and the artillery school, as well as
the military and civil hospital, and not far off is the Frederik-Hendrik
citadel built in 1837. Farther inland, at Meester
Cornelis, are barracks and a school for under-officers. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page508" id="page508"></a>508</span>
Koningsplein is a large open square surrounded by mansions of
the wealthier classes. Noordwijk is principally inhabited by
lesser merchants and subordinate officials. There is an orphan
asylum in the district of Parapatna. Batavia has various educational
and scientific institutions of note. In 1851 the government
founded a medical school for Javanese, and in 1860 the
&ldquo;Gymnasium William III.&rdquo; in which a comprehensive education is
bestowed. A society of arts and sciences (which possesses an
excellent museum) was established in 1778, a royal physical
society in 1850, and a society for the promotion of industry and
agriculture in 1853. In addition to the <i>Transactions</i> of these
societies&mdash;many of which contain valuable contributions to their
respective departments in their relation to the East Indies&mdash;a
considerable number of publications are issued in Batavia.
Among miscellaneous buildings of importance may be mentioned
the public hall known as the <i>Harmonie</i>, the theatre, club-house
and several fine hotels.</p>

<p>The population of Batavia is varied, the Dutch residents being
a comparatively small class, and greatly intermixed with Portuguese
and Malays. Here are found members of the different
Indian nations, originally slaves; Arabs, who are principally
engaged in navigation, but also trade in gold and precious
stones; Javanese, who are cultivators; and Malays, chiefly
boatmen and sailors, and adherents of Mahommedanism. The
Chinese are both numerous and industrious. They were long
greatly oppressed by the Dutch government, and in 1740 they
were massacred to the number of 12,000.</p>

<p>Batavia Bay is rendered secure by a number of islands at its
mouth, but grows very shallow towards the shore. The construction
of the new harbour at Tanjong Priok, to the east of the
old one, was therefore of the first importance. The works,
begun in 1877 and completed in 1886, connect the town with
Tanjong (&ldquo;cape&rdquo;) Priok by a canal, and include an outer port
formed by two breakwaters, 6072 ft. long, with a width at
entrance of 408 ft. and a depth of 27 ft. throughout. The inner
port has 3282 ft. of quayage; its length is 3609 ft., breadth 573
ft. and depth 24 ft. There is also a coal dock, and the port has
railway and roadway connexion with Batavia. The river Jilivong
is navigable 2 m. inland for vessels of 30 or 40 tons, but the
entrance is narrow, and requires continual attention to keep it
open.</p>

<p>The exports from Batavia to the other islands of the archipelago,
and to the ports in the Malay Peninsula, are rice, sago,
coffee, sugar, salt, oil, tobacco, teak timber and planks, Java
cloths, brass wares, &amp;c., and European, Indian and Chinese
goods. The produce of the Eastern Islands is also collected
at its ports for re-exportation to India, China and
Europe&mdash;namely, gold-dust, diamonds, camphor, benzoin and other
drugs; edible bird-nests, trepang, rattans, beeswax,
tortoise-shell, and dyeing woods from Borneo and Sumatra; tin from
Banka; spices from the Moluccas; fine cloths from Celebes and
Bali; and pepper from Sumatra. From Bengal are imported
opium, drugs and cloths; from China, teas, raw silk, silk
piece-goods, coarse China wares, paper, and innumerable smaller
articles for the Chinese settlers. The tonnage of vessels clearing
from Batavia to countries beyond the archipelago had increased
from 879,000 tons in 1887 to nearly 1,500,000 tons by the end
of the century. The old and new towns are connected by steam
tramways. The Batavia-Buitenzorg railway passes the new
town, thus connecting it with the main railway which crosses
the island from west to east.</p>

<p>Almost the only manufactures of any importance are the
distillation of arrack, which is principally carried on by Chinese,
the burning of lime and bricks, and the making of pottery. The
principal establishment for monetary transactions is the Java
Bank, established in 1828 with a capital of £500,000.</p>

<p>Batavia owes its origin to the Dutch governor-general Pieter
Both, who in 1610 established a factory at Jacatra (which had
been built on the ruins of the old Javanese town of Sunda
Calappa), and to his successor, Jan Pieters Coen, who in 1619
founded in its stead the present city, which soon acquired a
flourishing trade and increased in importance. In 1699 Batavia
was visited by a terrible earthquake, and the streams were
choked by the mud from the volcano of Gunong Salak; they
overflowed the surrounding country and made it a swamp, by
which the climate was so affected that the city became notorious
for its unhealthiness, and was in great danger of being altogether
abandoned. In the twenty-two years from 1730 to 1752,
1,100,000 deaths are said to have been recorded. General
Daendels, who was governor from 1808 to 1811, caused the
ramparts of the town to be demolished, and began to form the
nucleus of a new city at Weltevreden. By 1816 nearly all the
Europeans had left the old town. In 1811 a British armament
was sent against the Dutch settlements in Java, which had been
incorporated by France, and to this force Batavia surrendered
on the 8th of August. It was restored, however, to the Dutch
by the treaty of 1814.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATAVIA,<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> a village and the county-seat of Genesee county,
New York, U.S.A., about 36 m. N.E. of Buffalo, on the
Tonawanda Creek. Pop. (1890) 7221; (1900) 9180, of whom
1527 were foreign-born; (1910), 11,613. Batavia is served by
the New York Central &amp; Hudson River, the Erie, and the
Lehigh Valley railways. It is the seat of the New York State
School for the Blind, and of St Joseph&rsquo;s Academy (Roman
Catholic), and has a historical museum, housed in the Old Holland
Land Office (1804), containing a large collection of relics of the
early days of New York, and a memorial library erected in 1889
in memory of a son by Mary E. Richmond, the widow of Dean
Richmond; the building contained in 1908 more than 14,000
volumes. The public schools are excellent; in them in 1898
Superintendent John Kennedy (b. 1846) introduced the method of
individual instruction now known as the &ldquo;Batavia scheme,&rdquo;
under which in rooms of more than fifty pupils there is, besides
the class teacher, an &ldquo;individual&rdquo; teacher who helps backward
children in their studies. Among Batavia&rsquo;s manufactures are
harvesters, ploughs, threshers and other agricultural implements,
firearms, rubber tires, shoes, shell goods, paper-boxes and inside
woodwork. In 1905 the city&rsquo;s factory products were valued at
$3,589,406, an increase of 39.5% over their value in 1900.
Batavia was laid out in 1801 by Joseph Ellicott (1760-1826),
the engineer who had been engaged in surveying the land known
as the &ldquo;Holland Purchase,&rdquo; of which Batavia was a part. The
village was incorporated in 1823. Here lived William Morgan,
whose supposed murder (1826) by members of the Masonic order
led to the organization of the Anti-Masonic party. Batavia was
the home during his last years of Dean Richmond (1804-1866), a
capitalist, a successful shipper and wholesaler of farm produce,
vice-president (1853-1864) and president (1864-1866) of the New
York Central railway, and a prominent leader of the Democratic
party in New York state.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATEMAN, HEZEKIAH LINTHICUM<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (1812-1875), American
actor and manager, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on the 6th
of December 1812. He was intended for an engineer, but in 1832
became an actor, playing with Ellen Tree (afterwards Mrs Charles
Kean) in juvenile leads. In 1855 he was manager of the St Louis
theatre for a few years and in 1859 moved to New York. In 1866
he was manager for his daughter Kate, and in 1871 returned to
London, where he took the Lyceum theatre. Here he engaged Henry
Irving, presenting him first in <i>The Bells</i>, with great success.
He died on the 22nd of March 1875.</p>

<p>His wife, <span class="sc">Sidney Frances</span> (1823-1881), daughter of Joseph
Cowell, an English actor who had settled in America, was also an
actress and the author of several popular plays, in one of which,
<i>Self</i> (1857), she and her husband made a great success. After
her husband&rsquo;s death Mrs Bateman continued to manage the Lyceum
till 1875. She later took the Sadler&rsquo;s Wells theatre, which she
managed until her death on the 13th of January 1881. She was
the first to bring to England an entire American company with an
American play, Joaquin Miller&rsquo;s <i>The Danites</i>.</p>

<p>Mr and Mrs Bateman had eight children, three of the four
daughters being educated for the stage. The two oldest, Kate
Josephine (b. 1842), and Ellen (b. 1845), known as the &ldquo;Bateman
children,&rdquo; began their theatrical career at an early age. In 1862
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>509</span>
Kate played in New York as Juliet and Lady Macbeth, and in
1863 had a great success in London as Leah in Augustin Daly&rsquo;s
adaptation of Mosenthal&rsquo;s <i>Deborah</i>. In 1866 she married George
Crowe, but returned to the stage in 1868, playing later as Lady
Macbeth with Henry Irving, and in 1875 in the title-part of
Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>Queen Mary</i>. When her mother opened the Sadler&rsquo;s
Wells theatre in 1879 Miss Bateman appeared as Helen Macgregor
in <i>Rob Roy</i>, and in 1881 as Margaret Field in Henry Arthur Jones&rsquo;
<i>His Wife</i>. Her daughter, Sidney Crowe (b. 1871), also became
an actress. Virginia Bateman (b. 1854), a younger sister of Kate,
born in Cincinnati, Ohio, went on the stage as a child, and first
appeared in London in the title-part of her mother&rsquo;s play,
<i>Fanchette</i>, in 1871. She created a number of important parts
during several seasons at the Lyceum and elsewhere. She
married Edward Compton the actor. Another sister was Isabel
(b. 1854), well known on the London stage.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATES, HARRY<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (1850-1899), British sculptor, was born at
Stevenage, Herts, on the 26th of April 1850. He began his career
as a carver&rsquo;s assistant, and before beginning the regular study of
plastic art he passed through a long apprenticeship in
architectural decoration. In 1879 he came to London and entered the
Lambeth School of Art, studying under Jules Dalou and Rodin,
and winning a silver medal in the national competition at South
Kensington. In 1881 he was admitted to the Royal Academy
schools, where in 1883 he won the gold medal and the travelling
scholarship of £200 with his relief of &ldquo;Socrates teaching the
People in the Agora,&rdquo; which showed grace of line and harmony of
composition. He then went to Paris and studied under Rodin.
A head and three small bronze panels (the &ldquo;Odyssey,&rdquo;) executed
by Bates in Paris, were exhibited at the Royal Academy, and
selected for purchase by the Chantrey trustees; but the selection
had to be cancelled because they had not been modelled
in England. His &ldquo;Aeneas&rdquo; (1885), &ldquo;Homer&rdquo; (1886), three
&ldquo;Psyche&rdquo; panels and &ldquo;Rhodope&rdquo; (1887) all showed marked
advance in form and dignity; and in 1892, after the exhibition of
his vigorously designed &ldquo;Hounds in Leash,&rdquo; Bates was elected
A.R.A. This and his &ldquo;Pandora,&rdquo; in marble and ivory, which
was bought in the same year for the Chantrey Bequest, are now
in the Tate Gallery. The portrait-busts of Harry Bates are good
pieces of realism&mdash;strong, yet delicate in technique, and excellent
in character. His statues have a picturesqueness in which the
refinement of the sculptor is always felt. Among the chief of
these are the fanciful &ldquo;Maharaja of Mysore,&rdquo; somewhat overladen
with ornament, and the colossal equestrian statue of Lord
Roberts (1896) upon its important pedestal, girdled with a frieze
of figures, now set up in Calcutta, and a statue of Queen Victoria
for Dundee. But perhaps his masterpiece, showing the sculptor&rsquo;s
delicate fancy and skill in composition, was an allegorical
presentment of &ldquo;Love and Life&rdquo;&mdash;a winged male figure in bronze, with
a female figure in ivory being crowned by the male. Bates died
in London on the 30th of January 1899, his premature death
robbing English plastic art of its most promising representative
at the time. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sculpture</a></span>.)</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATES, HENRY WALTER<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (1825-1892), English naturalist
and explorer, was born at Leicester on the 8th of February 1825.
His father, a manufacturing hosier, intended him for business,
and for a time the son yielded to his wishes, escaping as often as
he could into the neighbouring country to gratify his love of
botany and entomology. In 1844 he met a congenial spirit in
Alfred Russel Wallace, and the result was discussion and execution
of a plan to explore some then little-known region of the
globe. The banks of the Amazons was the district chosen, and in
April 1848 the two friends sailed in a trader for Pará. They had
little or no money, but hoped to meet their expenses by the sale of
duplicate specimens. After two years Bates and Wallace agreed
to collect independently, Wallace taking the Rio Negro and the
upper waters of the Orinoco, while Bates continued his route up
the great river for 1400 m. He remained in the country eleven
years, during which time he collected no fewer than 8000 species
of insects new to science. His long residence in the tropics, with
the privations which it entailed, undermined his health. Nor had
the exile from home the compensation of freeing him from
financial cares, which hung heavy on him till he had the good
fortune to be appointed in 1864 assistant-secretary of the Royal
Geographical Society, a post which, to the inestimable gain of the
society, and the advantage of a succession of explorers, to whom
he was alike Nestor and Mentor, he retained till his death on the
16th of February 1892. Bates is best known as the auther of one
of the most delightful books of travel in the English language,
<i>The Naturalist on the Amazons</i> (1863), the writing of which, as the
correspondence between the two has shown, was due to Charles
Darwin&rsquo;s persistent urgency. &ldquo;Bates,&rdquo; wrote Darwin to Sir
Charles Lyell, &ldquo;is second only to Humboldt in describing a
tropical forest.&rdquo; But his most memorable contribution to
biological science, and more especially to that branch of it which
deals with the agencies of modification of organisms, was his paper
on the &ldquo;Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley,&rdquo; read before the
Linnaean Society in 1861. He therein, as Darwin testified, clearly
stated and solved the problem of &ldquo;mimicry,&rdquo; or the superficial
resemblances between totally different species and the likeness
between an animal and its surroundings, whereby it evades its
foes or conceals itself from its prey. Bates&rsquo;s other contributions
to the literature of science and travel were sparse and fugitive,
but he edited for several years a periodical of <i>Illustrated Travels</i>.
A man of varied tastes, he devoted the larger part of his leisure to
entomology, notably to the classification of coleoptera. Of these
he left an extensive and unique collection, which, fortunately for
science, was purchased intact by René Oberthur of Rennes.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATES, JOHN<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span>. A famous case in English constitutional
history, tried before the court of exchequer in November 1606,
arose out of the refusal of a merchant of the Levant Company,
John Bates, to pay an extra duty of 5s. per cwt. on imported
currants levied by the sole authority of the crown in addition to
the 2s. 6d. granted by the Statute of Tonnage and Poundage, on
the ground that such an imposition was illegal without the
sanction of parliament. The unanimous decision of the four
barons of the exchequer in favour of the crown threatened to
establish a precedent which, in view of the rapidly increasing
foreign trade, would have made the king independent of
parliament.  The judgments of Chief Baron Fleming and Baron Clark
are preserved. The first declares that &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s power is
double, ordinary and absolute, and they have several laws and
ends. That of the ordinary is for the profit of particular
subjects, for the execution of civil justice ... in the ordinary
courts, and by the civilians is nominated <i>jus privatum</i>, and with
us common law; and these laws cannot be changed without
parliament.... The absolute power of the king is not that
which is converted or executed to private uses to the benefit of
particular persons, but is only that which is applied to the general
benefit of the people and is <i>salus populi</i>; and this power is not
guided by the rules which direct only at the common law, and is
most properly named policy or government; and as the constitution
of this body varieth with the time, so varieth this
absolute law, according to the wisdom of the king, for the
common good; and these being general rules, and true as they
are, all things done within these rules are lawful. The matter in
question is material matter of state, and ought to be ruled by
the rules of policy, and if it be so, the king hath done well to
execute his extraordinary power. All customs (<i>i.e.</i> duties levied
at the ports), be they old or new, are no other but the effects and
issues of trades and commerce with foreign nations; but all
commerce and affairs with foreigners, all wars and peace, all
acceptance and admitting for foreign current coin, all parties and
treaties whatsoever are made by the absolute power of the king;
and he who hath power of causes hath power also of effects.&rdquo;
Baron Clark, in his judgment, concurred, declaring that the
seaports were the king&rsquo;s ports, and that, since foreign merchants
were admitted to them only by leave of the crown, the crown
possessed also the right of fixing the conditions under which they
should be admitted, including the imposition of a money payment.
Incidentally, Baron Clark, in reply to the argument that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>510</span>
the king&rsquo;s right to levy impositions was limited by the statute of
1370-1371, advanced a principle still more dangerous to constitutional
liberty. &ldquo;The statute of the 45 Edward III. cap. 4,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;which hath been so much urged, that no new imposition
shall be imposed upon wool-fells, wool or leather, but only the
custom and subsidy granted to the king&mdash;this extends only to
the king himself and shall not bind his successors, for it is a
principal part of the crown of England, which the king cannot
diminish.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATES, JOSHUA<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (1788-1864), American financier, was born
in Weymouth, Massachusetts, on the 10th of October 1788, of an
old Massachusetts family prominent in colonial affairs. After
several winters&rsquo; schooling in his native town, he entered the
counting-house of William Gray &amp; Son in Boston. In 1809 he
began business on his own account, but failed during the War
of 1812 and again became associated with the Grays, then the
largest shipowners in America, by whom a few years later he was
sent to London in charge of their European business. There he
came into relations with the Barings, and in 1826 formed a
partnership with John, a son of Sir Thomas Baring. Two years
later both partners were admitted to the firm of Baring Brothers
&amp; Company, of which Bates eventually became senior partner,
occupying in consequence an influential position in the British
financial world. In 1853-1854 he acted with rare impartiality
and justice as umpire of the international commission appointed
to settle claims growing out of the War of 1812. In 1852-1855
he contributed $100,000 in books and in cash for a public library
in Boston, the money to be invested and the annual income to be
applied to the purchase of books. Upon his death the &ldquo;upper
hall,&rdquo; or main reference-room (opened in 1861) in the building
erected in 1858 by the order of the library trustees, was named
Bates Hall; and upon the opening of the new building in 1895
this name was transferred to its principal reading-room, one of
the finest library halls in the world. During the Civil War
Bates&rsquo;s sympathies were strongly with the Union, and besides
aiding the United States government fiscal agents in various
ways, he used his influence to prevent the raising of loans for
the Confederacy. He died in London on the 24th of September
1864.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATES, WILLIAM<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> (1625-1699), English nonconformist
divine, was born in London in November 1625. He was admitted
to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and removed thence to King&rsquo;s
College in 1644. Of Presbyterian belief, he held the rich living
of St Dunstan&rsquo;s-in-the-West, London. He was one of the commissioners
at the conference in the Savoy, for reviewing the
public liturgy, and was concerned in drawing up the exceptions
to the Book of Common Prayer. Notwithstanding this he was
appointed chaplain to Charles II., and was offered the deanery
of Lichfield and Coventry, but he came out in 1662 as one of the
2000 ejected ministers. Bates was of an amiable character, and
enjoyed the friendship of the lord-keeper Bridgeman, the lord-chancellor
Finch, the earl of Nottingham and Archbishop
Tillotson. With other moderate churchmen he made several
efforts towards a comprehensive settlement, but the bishops
were uncompromising. He addressed William and Mary on
their accession in behalf of the dissenters. After some years of
pastoral service at Hackney he died there on the 14th of July
1699. Bates published <i>Select Lives of Illustrious and Pious
Persons</i> in Latin; and after his death all his works, except this,
were printed in 1 vol. fol.; again in 1723; and in 4 vols. 8vo
in 1815. They treat of practical theology and include <i>Considerations
on the Existence of God and the Immortality of the Soul</i>
(1676), <i>Four Last Things</i> (1691), <i>Spiritual Perfection</i> (1699).</p>

madrigals, which give him an important place among Elizabethan

<p><span class="bold">BATH, THOMAS THYNNE,<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Marquess of</span> (1734-1796),
English politician, was the elder son of Thomas Thynne, 2nd
Viscount Weymouth (1710-1751), and the great-grandnephew
of Thomas Thynne (<i>c.</i> 1640-1714), the friend of Bishop Ken,
who was created Baron Thynne and Viscount Weymouth in
1682. His mother was Louisa (d. 1736), daughter of John
Carteret, 1st Earl Granville, and a descendant of the family of
Granville who held the earldom of Bath from 1661 to 1711. The
Thynnes are descended from Sir John Thynne, the builder of
Longleat, the splendid seat of the family in Wiltshire. Sir John,
owed his wealth and position to the favour of his master, the
protector Somerset; he was comptroller of the household of
the princess Elizabeth, and was a person of some importance
after the princess became queen. He died in April 1580.
Another famous member of this family was Thomas Thynne
(1648-1682), called on account of his wealth &ldquo;Tom of Ten
Thousand.&rdquo; He is celebrated by Dryden as Issachar in <i>Absalom
and Achitophel</i>, and was murdered in London by some Swedes
in February 1682.</p>

<p>Born on the 13th of September 1734, Thomas Thynne succeeded,
his father as 3rd Viscount Weymouth in January 1751, and was
lord-lieutenant of Ireland for a short time during 1765, although
he never visited that country. Having, however, become
prominent in English politics he was appointed secretary of
state for the northern department in January 1768; he acted
with great promptitude during the unrest caused by John
Wilkes and the Middlesex election of 1768. He was then attacked
and libelled by Wilkes, who was consequently expelled from the
House of Commons. Before the close of 1768 he was transferred,
from the northern to the southern department, but he resigned
in December 1770 in the midst of the dispute with Spain over
the possession of the Falkland Islands. In November 1775
Weymouth returned to his former office of secretary for the
southern department, undertaking in addition the duties
attached to the northern department for a few months in 1779,
but he resigned both positions in the autumn of this year. In
1789 he was created marquess of Bath, and he died on the 19th
of November 1796. Weymouth was a man of considerable
ability especially as a speaker, but according to more modern
standards his habits were very coarse, resembling those of his
friend and frequent companion, Charles James Fox. Horace
Walpole refers frequently to his idleness and his drunkenness,
and in early life at least &ldquo;his great fortune he had damaged by
such profuse play, that his house was often full of bailiffs.&rdquo; He
married Elizabeth (d. 1825), daughter of William Bentinck,
2nd duke of Portland, by whom he had three sons and ten
daughters. His eldest son Thomas (1765-1837) succeeded to
his titles, while the two younger ones, George (1770-1838) and
John (1772-1849), succeeded in turn to the barony of Carteret
of Hawnes, which came to them from their uncle, Henry
Frederick Thynne (1735-1826). Weymouth&rsquo;s great-grandson,
John Alexander, 4th marquess of Bath (1831-1896), the author
of <i>Observations on Bulgarian affairs</i> (1880), was succeeded as
5th marquess by his son Thomas Henry (b. 1862).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATH, WILLIAM PULTENEY,<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span> (1684-1764),
generally known by the surname of <span class="sc">Pulteney</span>, English politician,
descended from an ancient family of Leicestershire, was the son
of William Pulteney by his first wife, Mary Floyd, and was born
in April 1684. The boy was sent to Westminster school, and
from it proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating the
31st of October 1700. At these institutions he acquired his deep
classical knowledge. On leaving Oxford he made the usual tour
on the continent. In 1705 he was brought into parliament by
Henry Guy (secretary of the treasury, 1679-1688, and June 1691
to February 1695) for the Yorkshire borough of Hedon, and at
his death on the 23rd of February 1710 inherited an estate of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page511" id="page511"></a>511</span>
£500 a year and £40,000 in cash. This seat was held by him
without a break until 1734. Throughout the reign of Queen Anne
William Pulteney played a prominent part in the struggles of
the Whigs, and on the prosecution of Sacheverell he exerted
himself with great zeal against that violent divine. When the
victorious Tories sent his friend Robert Walpole to the Tower
in 1712, Pulteney championed his cause in the House of
Commons and with the leading Whigs Visited him in his prison-chamber.
He held the post of secretary of war from 1714 to
1717 in the first ministry of George I., and when the committee
of secrecy on the Utrecht treaty was formed in April 1715 the
list included the flame of William Pulteney. Two years later
(6th of July 1716), he became one of the privy council. When
Townshend was dismissed, in April 1717, from his post of lord-lieutenant
of Ireland, and Walpole resigned his places, they
were followed in their retirement by Pulteney. The crash of the
South Sea Company restored Walpole to the highest position,
but all that he offered to Pulteney was a peerage. The offer
was rejected, but in May 1723 Pulteney stooped to accept the
lucrative but insignificant post of cofferer of the household. In
this obscure position he was content for some time to await the
future; but when he found himself neglected he opposed the
proposition of Walpole to discharge the debts of the civil list, and
in April 1725 was dismissed from his sinecure. From the day of
his dismissal to that of his ultimate triumph Pulteney remained
in opposition, and, although Sir Robert Walpole attempted in
1730 to conciliate him by the offer of Townshend&rsquo;s place and of
a peerage, all his overtures were spurned. Pulteney&rsquo;s resentment
was not confined to his speeches in parliament. With
Bolingbroke he set on foot in December 1726 the well-known
periodical called the <i>Craftsman</i>, and in its pages the minister
was incessantly denounced for many years. Lord Hervey
published an attack on the <i>Craftsman</i>, and Pulteney, either
openly or behind the person of Amhurst, its editor, replied to the
attack. Whether the question at issue was the civil list, the
excise, the income of the prince of Wales, or the state of domestic
affairs Pulteney was ready with a pamphlet, and the minister
or one of his friends came out with a reply. For his &ldquo;Proper
reply to a late scurrilous libel&rdquo; (<i>Craftsman</i>, 1731), an answer to
&ldquo;Sedition and defamation displayed,&rdquo; he was challenged to a
duel by Lord Hervey; for another, &ldquo;An answer to one part of
an infamous libel entitled remarks on the <i>Craftsman&rsquo;s</i> indication
of his two honourable patrons,&rdquo; he was in July 1731 struck off
the roll of privy councillors and dismissed from the commission
of the peace in several counties. In print Pulteney was inferior
to Bolingbroke alone among the antagonists of Walpole, but in
parliament, from which St John was excluded, he excelled all his
comrades. When the sinking fund was appropriated in 1733
his voice was the foremost in denunciation; when the excise
scheme in the same year was stirring popular feeling to its lowest
depths the passion of the multitude broke out in his oratory.
Through Walpole&rsquo;s prudent withdrawal of the latter measure
the fall, of his ministry was averted. Bolingbroke withdrew to
France on the suggestion, it is said, of Pulteney, and the opposition
was weakened by the dissensions of the leaders.</p>

<p>From the general election of 1734 until his elevation to the
peerage Pulteney sat for Middlesex. For some years after this
election the minister&rsquo;s assailants made little progress in their
attack, but in 1738 the troubles with Spain supplied them with
the opportunity which they desired. Walpole long argued for
peace, but he was feebly supported in his own cabinet, and the
frenzy of the people for War knew no bounds. In an evil moment
for his own reputation he consented to remain in office and to
gratify popular passion with a war against Spain. His downfall
was not long deferred. War was declared in 1739; a new
parliament was summoned in the summer of 1741, and over the
divisions on the election petitions the ministry of Walpole fell to
pieces. The task of forming the new administration was after
some delay entrusted to Pulteney, who weakly offered the post
of first lord of the treasury to that harmless politician the earl
of Wilmington, and contented himself with a seat in the cabinet
and a peerage thinking that by this action he would preserve
his reputation for consistency in disdaining office and yet retain
his supremacy in the ministry. At this act popular feeling broke
out into open indignation, and from the moment of his elevation
to the Upper House Pulteney&rsquo;s influence dwindled to nothing.
Horace Walpole asserts that when Pulteney wished to recall his
desire for a peerage it was forced upon him through the ex-minister&rsquo;s
advice by the king, and another chronicler of the times
records that when victor and vanquished met in the House of
Lords, the one as Lord Orford, the other as the earl of Bath, the
remark was made by the exulting Orford: &ldquo;Here we are, my
lord, the two most insignificant fellows in England.&rdquo; On the
14th of July 1742 Pulteney was created Baron Pulteney of
Hedon, Co. York, Viscount Pulteney of Wrington, Co. Somerset,
and earl of Bath. On the 20th of February he had been restored
to his rank in the privy council. At Wilmington&rsquo;s death in 1743
he made application to the king for the post of first lord of the
treasury, only to find that it had been conferred on Henry
Pelham. For two days, 10th-12th February 1746, he was at the
head of a ministry, but in &ldquo;48 hours, three quarters, seven
minutes, and eleven seconds&rdquo; it collapsed. An occasional
pamphlet and an infrequent speech were afterwards the sole
fruits of Lord Bath&rsquo;s talents. His praises whilst in retirement
have been sung by two bishops, Zachary Pearce and Thomas
Newton. He died on the 7th of July 1764, and was buried on
the 17th of July in his own vault in Islip chapel, Westminster
Abbey. He married on the 27th of December 1714 Anna Maria,
daughter and co-heiress of John Gumley of Isleworth, commissary-general
to the army who was often satirized by the wits of the
day (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 3rd S. ii. 402-403, iii. 490). She died on
the 14th of September 1758, and their only son William died
unmarried at Madrid on the 12th of February 1763. Pulteney&rsquo;s
vast fortune came in 1767 to William Johnstone of Dumfries
(third son of Sir James Johnstone), who had married Frances,
daughter and co-heiress of his cousin, Daniel Pulteney, a bitter
antagonist of Walpole in parliament, and had taken the name of
Pulteney.</p>

<p>Pulteney&rsquo;s eloquence was keen and incisive, sparkling with
vivacity and with allusions drawn from the literature of his own
country and of Rome. Of business he was never fond, and the
loss in 1734 of his trusted friend John Merrill, who had supplied
the qualities which he lacked, was feelingly lamented by him in a
letter to Swift. His chief weakness was a passion for money.
Lord Bath has left no trace of the possession of practical
statesmanship.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATH,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> a city, municipal, county and parliamentary borough,
and health resort of Somersetshire, England, on the Great
Western, Midland, and Somerset &amp; Dorset railways, 107½ m. W.
by S. of London. Pop. (1901) 49,839. Its terraces and crescents,
built mostly of grey freestone, cover the slopes and heights of
the abrupt hills which rise like an amphitheatre above the
winding valley of the river Avon. The climate is pleasant, and
the city, standing amidst fine scenery, itself possesses a number
of beautiful walks and gardens. Jointly with Wells, it is an
episcopal see of the Church of England. The abbey church
of St Peter and St Paul occupies the site of earlier Saxon and
Norman churches, founded in connexion with a 7th-century
convent, which was transferred for a time to a body of secular
canons, and from about 970 until the Dissolution, to Benedictine
monks. The present cruciform building dates from the 15th
century, being a singularly pure and ornate example of late
Perpendicular work. From the number of its windows, it has
been called &ldquo;The Lantern of the West,&rdquo; and especially noteworthy
is the great west window, with seven lights, and flanking
turrets on which are carved figures of the angels ascending and
descending on Jacob&rsquo;s Ladder. Within are the tombs of James
Quin, the actor, with an epitaph by Garrick; Richard Nash;
Thomas Malthus the economist; William Broome the poet, and
many others. Some of the monuments are the work of Bacon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page512" id="page512"></a>512</span>
Flaxman and Chantrey. Slight traces of the previous Norman
building remain. There are many other churches and chapels
in Bath, the oldest being that of St Thomas of Canterbury, and
one of the most interesting St Swithin&rsquo;s, which contains the tombs
of Christopher Anstey and Madame d&rsquo;Arblay. Among educational
institutions may be mentioned the free grammar school, founded
by Edward VI., the Wesleyan College, originally established
at Bristol by John Wesley, and the Roman Catholic College.
The hospital of St John was founded in the 12th century.
The public buildings include a guild hall, assembly rooms,
Jubilee hall, art gallery and library, museum, literary and
scientific institute, and theatres. In the populous suburb
of Twerton (pop. 11,098), there are lias quarries, and bricks
and woollen cloths are manufactured. The parliamentary borough
returns two members. The city is governed by a mayor, 14
aldermen and 42 councillors. Area, 3382 acres.</p>

<p>The mineral springs supply several distinct establishments.
The temperature varies in the different springs from 117° to
120° F, and the specific gravity of the hot baths is 1.002. The
principal substances in solution are calcium and sodium sulphates,
and sodium and magnesium chlorides. Traces of radium have been
revealed, and the gases contain argon and helium. The waters are
very beneficial in cases of rheumatism, gout, neuralgia, sciatica,
diseases of the liver, and cutaneous and scrofulous affections.
The highest archaeological interest, moreover, attaches to the
baths in view of the magnificent Roman remains testifying to
the early recognition of the value of the waters. It may here be
noted that two distinct legends ascribe the foundation of Bath
to a British king Bladud. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth
this monarch gave its healing power to the water by his spells.
According to a later version, he was banished as a leper, and
made the discovery leading to his cure, and to the origin of Bath,
whilst wandering as a swineherd in 863 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> This, at least, is
the date inscribed on a statue of Bladud placed in the Pump
Room in 1699. There is, however, no real evidence of a British
settlement. By the Romans Bath was named <i>Aquae Sulis</i>, the
name indicating the dedication to a British goddess Sul or
Sulis, whom the Romans considered the counterpart of Minerva.
There were a temple of the goddess and a few houses for priests,
officials and visitors, besides the large baths, and the place was
apparently walled; but it did not contain a large resident
population. Many relics have been disinterred, such as altars,
inscriptions, fragments of stone carvings and figures, Samian
ware, and others. The chief buildings were apparently grouped
near the later abbey churchyard, and included, besides two
temples, a magnificent bath, discovered when the duke of
Kingston pulled down the old priory in 1755 to form the
Kingston Baths. Successive excavations have rendered accessible a
remarkable series of remains, including several baths, a <i>sudarium</i>,
and conduits. The main bath still receives its water (now for
the purpose of cooling) through the original conduit. The
fragmentary colonnade surrounding this magnificent relic still
supports the street and buildings beneath which it lies, the
Roman foundations having been left untouched. The remains
of the bath and of the temple are among the most striking Roman
antiquities in western Europe.</p>

<p>Bath (variously known as Achemann, Hat Bathun, Bathonea,
Batha) was a place of note in Saxon times, King Edgar being
crowned there in 973. It was a royal borough governed by a reeve,
with a burg mote in 907. Richard I. granted the first charter in
1189, which allowed the same privileges as Winchester to the
members of the merchant gild. This was confirmed by Henry III.
in 1236, 1247 and 1256, by charters giving the burgesses of Bath
the right to elect coroners, with freedom from arrest for the debts
of others, and from the interference of sheriffs or kings&rsquo; bailiffs.
Charters were granted by succeeding kings in 1312, 1322, 1341,
1382, 1399, 1414, 1432, 1447, 1466 and 1545. The existence of a
corporation being assumed in the earliest royal charter, and a
common seal having been used since 1249, there was no formal
incorporation of Bath until the charter of 1590, 1794 and 1835.
Parliamentary representation began in 1297. Various fairs were
granted to Bath, to be held on the 29th of August, the 9th of
August, the 30th of June to the 8th of July (called Cherry Fair),
the 1st of February to the 6th of February, in 1275, 1305, 1325
and 1545 respectively. Fairs are now held on the 4th of February
and on the Monday after the 9th of December. These fairs were
flourishing centres of the cloth trade in the middle ages, but
this industry has long departed. Bath &ldquo;beaver,&rdquo; however, was
known throughout England, and Chaucer makes his &ldquo;Wife of
Bath&rdquo; excel the cloth-weavers &ldquo;of Ypres and of Gaunt.&rdquo; The
golden age of Bath began in the 18th century, and is linked with
the work of the two architects Wood (both named John), of Ralph
Allen, their patron, and of Richard Nash, master of the ceremonies.
Previously the baths had been ill-kept, the lodging poor,
the streets beset by footpads. All this was changed by the
architectural scheme, including Queen Square, the Royal Crescent
and the North and South Parades, which was chiefly designed by
the elder Wood, and chiefly executed by his son. Instead of the
booth which did duty as a gaming club and chocolate house, Nash
provided the assembly rooms which figure largely in the pages of
Fielding, Smollett, Burney, Dickens and their contemporaries.
Anstey published his <i>New Bath Guide</i> to ridicule the laws of
taste which &ldquo;Beau&rdquo; Nash dictated; but two royal visits, in 1734 and
1738, established Bath as a centre of English fashion. The
weekly markets granted on Wednesday and Saturday in 1305 are
still held.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATH,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> a city, port of entry, and the county-seat of Sagadahoc
county, Maine, U.S.A., on the W. bank of the Kennebec river,
12 m. from its mouth and 36 m. N.E. of Portland. Pop. (1890)
8723; (1900) 10,477, of whom 1759 were foreign-born; (1910,
census) 9396. It is served by the Maine Central railway, by
steamboat lines to Boston, and by inter-urban electric railway.
The city covers an area of about 9 sq. m., and extends along the
W. bank of the river for about 5 m.; the business district is only
a few feet above sea-level, but most of the residences are on higher
ground. The streets are well shaded, chiefly with elms. At Bath
are the state military and naval orphan asylum, two homes for
the aged, and a soldiers&rsquo; monument. Bath has a good harbour
and its principal industry is the building of ships, both of wood
and of iron and steel, several vessels of the United States navy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page513" id="page513"></a>513</span>
have been built here. In 1905 three-fourths of the city&rsquo;s
wage-earners were employed in this industry. Bath also manufactures
lumber, iron and brass goods, and has a considerable trade in ice,
coal, lumber and iron and steel. First settled about 1660, Bath
was a part of Georgetown until 1781, when it was incorporated as
a separate town; in 1789 it was made a port of entry, and in 1847
was chartered as a city.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATHGATE,<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> a municipal and police burgh of Linlithgowshire,
Scotland, 19 m. W. by S. of Edinburgh by the North British
railway. Pop. (1901) 7549. The district is rich in limestone, coal,
ironstone, shale and fireclay, all of which are worked. Silver also
was once mined. The manufactures include paraffin, paper, glass,
chemicals, flour and whisky, and freestone is quarried. The burgh
is a considerable centre for agricultural produce. Bathgate
became a burgh of barony in 1824 and a police burgh in 1865.
Although it was not until the development of its mineral wealth
that it attained to commercial importance, it is a place of some
antiquity, and formed the dowry of Marjory, Robert Bruce&rsquo;s
daughter, who married Walter, the hereditary steward of Scotland,
in 1315.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATHOLITE<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="bothus">&#946;&#959;&#952;&#973;&#962;</span>, deep, and <span class="grk" title="litos">&#955;&#953;&#952;&#972;&#962;</span>, a stone), in
geology, a term given to certain intrusive rock masses.
Especially in districts which are composed principally of rocks
belonging to the older geological systems extensive areas of
granite frequently occur. By their relations to the strata
around them, it is clear that these granites have been forced into
their present positions in a liquid state, and under great pressure.
The bedding planes of stratified rocks are wedged apart and
tongues of granite have been injected into them, while cracks
have been opened up and filled with intrusions in the shape of
igneous veins. Great masses of the strata which the granite has
invaded are often floated off, and are found lying in the heart
of the granite much altered by the heat to which they have been
exposed, and traversed by the igneous rock in ramifying threads.
Such granite intrusions are generally known as bosses from their
rounded surfaces, and the frequency with which they form
flattish dome-shaped hills, rising above the older rocks surrounding
them. At one time many geologists held that in
certain situations the granite had arisen from the complete
fusion and transformation of the stratified rocks over a limited
area of intense metamorphism. The chemical no less than the
structural relations of the two sets of rocks, however, preclude
the acceptance of this hypothesis. Obviously the granite is an
intruder which has welled up from below, and has cooled gradually,
and solidified in its present situation.</p>

<p>Regarding the mechanism of this process there are two
theories which hold the field, each having a large number of
supporters. One school considers that they are mostly &ldquo;batholites&rdquo;
or conical masses rising from great depths and eating up
the strata which lie above and around them. The frequency
of inclusions of the surrounding rocks, their rounded shapes
indicating that they have been partly dissolved by the igneous
magma, the intense alteration which they have undergone
pointing to a state approaching actual fusion, the extensive
changes induced in the rocks which adjoin the granite, the
abundance of veins, and the unusual modifications of the granite
which occur where it comes in contact with the adjacent strata,
are adduced as evidence that there has been absorption and
digestion of the country rock by the intrusive mass. These
views are in favour especially in France; and instances are
cited in which as the margins of the granite are approached
diorites and other rocks make their appearance, which are
ascribed to the effect which admixture with dissolved sedimentary
material has had on the composition of the granite
magma; at the same time the schists have been permeated
with felspar from the igneous rocks, and are said to have been
felspathized.</p>

<p>The opponents of this theory hold these granitic masses to be
&ldquo;laccolites&rdquo; (Gr. <span class="grk" title="lakkos">&#955;&#940;&#954;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, a cistern), or great cake-shaped
injections of molten rock, which have been pressed from below
into planes of weakness in the upper portions of the earth&rsquo;s
crust, taking the lines of least resistance, and owing their shape
to the varying flexibility of the strata they penetrated. The
modifications of the granite are ascribed to magmatic segregation
(chemical and physical processes which occasioned diffusion of
certain components towards the cooling surfaces). Absorption
of country rock is held to be unimportant in amount, and insufficient
to account for the great spaces in the schists which
are occupied by the granite. Those who support this theory
leave the question of the ultimate source of the granite unanswered,
but consider that it is of deep-seated origin, and the
bosses which now appear at the surface are only comparatively
superficial manifestations.</p>

<p>The bulk of the evidence is in favour of the laccolitic theory;
in fact it has been clearly demonstrated in many important
cases. Still it is equally clear that many granites are not merely
passive injections, but have assimilated much foreign rock.
Possibly much depends on the chemical composition of the
respective masses, and on the depths and temperatures at which
the intrusion took place. Increase of pressure and of temperature,
which we know to take place at great depths, would stimulate
resorption of sedimentary material, and by retarding cooling
would allow time for dissolved foreign substances to diffuse
widely through the magma.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATHONIAN SERIES,<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> in geology. The typical Bathonian
is the Great Oolite series of England, and the name was derived
from the &ldquo;Bath Oolite,&rdquo; so extensively mined and quarried
in the vicinity of that city, where the principal strata were first
studied by W. Smith. The term was first used by J. d&rsquo;Omalius
d&rsquo;Halloy in 1843 (<i>Precis Geol</i>.) as a synonym for &ldquo;Dogger&rdquo;; but
it was limited in 1849 by A. d&rsquo;Orbigny (<i>Pal. Franc. Jur</i>. i.
p. 607). In 1864 Mayer-Eymar (<i>Tabl. Synchron</i>.) used the word
&ldquo;Bathien&rdquo; = Bajocian + Bathonian (sen. str.). According to
English practice, the Bathonian includes the following formations
in descending order: Cornbrash, Forest Marble with Bradford
Clay, Great or Bath Oolite, Stonesfield Slate and Fullers&rsquo; Earth.
(The Fullers&rsquo; Earth is sometimes regarded as constituting a
separate stage, the &ldquo;Fullonian.&rdquo;) The &ldquo;Bathonien&rdquo; of some
French geologists differs from the English Bathonian in that
it includes at the base the zone of the ammonite <i>Parkinsonia
Parkinsoni</i>, which in England is placed at the summit of
the Inferior Oolite. The Bathonian is the equivalent of the
upper part of the &ldquo;Dogger&rdquo; (Middle Jurassic) of Germany,
or to the base of the Upper Brown Jura (substage &ldquo;E&rdquo; of
Quenstedt).</p>

<p>Rocks of Bathonian age are well developed in Europe: in
the N.W. and S.W. oolite limestones are characteristically
associated with coral-bearing, crinoidal and other varieties,
and with certain beds of clay. In the N. and N.E., Russia,
&amp;c., clays, sandstones and ferruginous oolites prevail, some of
the last being exploited for iron. They occur also in the
extreme north of America and in the Arctic regions, Greenland,
Franz Josef Land, &amp;c.; in Africa, Algeria, German East Africa,
Madagascar and near the Cape (Enon Beds); in India, Rajputana
and Gulf of Cutch, and in South America.</p>

<p>The well-known Caen stone of Normandy and &ldquo;Hauptrogenstein&rdquo;
of Swabia, as well as the &ldquo;Eisenkalk&rdquo; of N.W.
Germany, and &ldquo;Klaus-Schichten&rdquo; of the Austrian Alps, are
of Bathonian age.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BÁTHORY, SIGISMUND<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Zsigmond</span>), (1572-1613), prince of
Transylvania, was the son of Christopher, prince of Transylvania,
and Elizabeth Bocskay, and nephew of the great Stephen
Báthory. He was elected prince in his father&rsquo;s lifetime, but being
quite young at his father&rsquo;s death (1581), the government was
entrusted to a regency. In 1588 he attained his majority, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page514" id="page514"></a>514</span>
following the advice of his favourite councillor Alfonso Carillo,
departed from the traditional policy of Transylvania in its best
days (when friendly relations with the Porte were maintained
as a matter of course, in order to counterpoise the ever hostile
influence of the house of Habsburg), and joined the league of
Christian princes against the Turk. The obvious danger of such
a course caused no small anxiety in the principality, and the
diet of Torda even went so far as to demand a fresh coronation
oath from Sigismund, and, on his refusal to render it, threatened
him with deposition. Ultimately Báthory got the better of his
opponents, and executed all whom he got into his hands (1595).
Nevertheless, if anybody could have successfully carried out an
anti-Turkish policy, it was certainly Báthory. He had inherited
the military genius of his uncle, and his victories astonished
contemporary Europe. In 1595 he subdued Walachia and
annihilated the army of Sinan Pasha at Giurgevo (October 28th).
The turning-point of his career was his separation from his wife,
the archduchess Christina of Austria, in 1599, an event followed
by his own abdication the same year, in order that he might take
orders. It was on this occasion that he offered the throne of
Transylvania to the emperor Rudolph II., in exchange for the
duchy of Oppeln. In 1600, however, at the head of an army of
Poles and Cossacks, he attempted to recover his throne, but was
routed by Michael, voivode of Moldavia, at Suceava. In February
1601 the diet of Klausenburg reinstated him, but again he was
driven out by Michael, never to return. He died at Prague in
1613. Báthory&rsquo;s indisputable genius must have been warped
by a strain of madness. His incalculableness, his savage cruelty
(like most of the princes of his house he was a fanatical Catholic
and persecutor) and his perpetual restlessness point plainly
enough to a disordered mind.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATHOS<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="bathos">&#946;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>), properly depth, the bottom or lowest
part of anything. The current usage for an anticlimax, a descent
&ldquo;from the sublime to the ridiculous,&rdquo; from the elevated to the
commonplace in literature or speech, is due to Pope&rsquo;s satire on
<i>Bathos</i> (<i>Miscellanies</i>, 1727-1728), &ldquo;the art of sinking in poetry.&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">BATHS<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span>. In the ordinary acceptation of the word a bath is
the immersion of the body in a medium different from the
ordinary one of atmospheric air, which medium is usually
common water in some form. In another sense it includes the
different media that may be used, and the various arrangements
by which they are applied.</p>

<p><i>Ancient Baths.</i>&mdash;Bathing, as serving both for cleanliness and
for pleasure, has been almost instinctively practised by nearly
every people. The most ancient records mention bathing in the
rivers Nile and Ganges. From an early period the Jews bathed
in running water, used both hot and cold baths, and employed
oils and ointments. So also did the Greeks; their earliest and
commonest form of bathing was swimming in rivers, and bathing
in them was practised by both sexes. Warm baths were, according
to Homer, used after fatigue or exercise. The Athenians
appear for a long time to have had only private baths, but afterwards
they had public ones: the latter seem to have originated
among the Lacedaemonians, who invented the hot-air bath, at
least the form of it called after them the <i>laconicum</i>. Although
the baths of the Greeks were not so luxurious as those of some
other nations, yet effeminate people were accused among them
of using warm baths in excess; and the bath servants appear to
have been rogues and thieves, as in later and larger establishments.
The Persians must have had handsomely equipped
baths, for Alexander the Great admired the luxury of the bath
of Darius.</p>

<p>But the baths of the Greeks, and probably of all Eastern
nations, were on a small scale as compared with those which
eventually sprang up among the Romans. In early times the
Romans used after exercise to throw themselves into the Tiber.
Next, when ample supplies of water were brought into the city,
large <i>piscinae</i>, or cold swimming baths, were constructed, the
earliest of which appear to have been the <i>piscina publica</i> (312
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>), near the Circus Maximus, supplied by the Appian aqueduct,
the <i>lavacrum</i> of Agrippina, and a bath at the end of the Clivus
Capitolinus. Next, small public as well as private baths were
built; and with the empire more luxurious forms of bathing
were introduced, and warm became far more popular than cold
baths.</p>

<p>Public baths (<i>balneae</i>) were first built in Rome after Clodius
brought in the supply of water from Praeneste, After that date
baths began to be common both in Rome and in other Italian
cities; and private baths, which gradually came into use, were
attached to the villas of the wealthy citizens. Maecenas was one
of the first who built public baths at his own expense. After
his time each emperor, as he wished to ingratiate himself with
the people, lavished the revenues of the state in the construction
of enormous buildings, which not only contained suites of bathing
apartments, but included gymnasia, and sometimes even theatres
and libraries. Such enormous establishments went by the name
of <i>thermae</i>. The principal thermae were those of Agrippa 21 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
of Nero 65 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, of Titus 81, of Domitian 95, of Commodus 185,
of Caracalla 217, and still later those of Diocletian 302, and of
Constantine. The technical skill displayed by the Romans in
rendering their walls and the sides of reservoirs impervious to
moisture, in conveying and heating water, and in constructing
flues for the conveyance of hot air through the walls, was of the
highest order.</p>

<p>The Roman baths contained swimming baths, warm baths,
baths of hot air, and vapour baths. The chief rooms (which in
the largest baths appear to have been mostly distinct, whereas
in smaller baths one chamber was made to do duty for more
than a single purpose) were the following:&mdash;(1) The <i>apodyterium</i>
or <i>spoliatorium</i>, where the bathers undressed; (2) the <i>alipterium</i>
or <i>unctuarium</i>, where oils and ointments were kept (although
the bathers often brought their own pomades), and where the
<i>aliptae,</i> anointed the bathers; (3) the <i>frigidarium</i>, or cool room,
<i>cella frigida</i>, in which usually was the cold bath, the <i>piscina</i> or
<i>baptisterium</i>; (4) the <i>tepidarium</i>, a room moderately heated, in
which the bathers rested for a time, but which was not meant
for bathing; (5) the <i>calidarium</i> or heating room, over the
<i>hypocaustum</i> or furnace; this in its commonest arrangement
had at one end a warm bath, the <i>alveus</i> or <i>calida lavatio</i>; at the
other end in a sort of alcove was (6) the <i>sudatorium</i> or <i>laconicum</i>,
which usually had a <i>labrum</i> or large vessel containing water,
with which bathers sprinkled themselves to help in rubbing off
the perspiration. In the largest baths the laconicum was probably
a separate chamber, a circular domical room with recesses
in the sides, and a large opening in the top; but there is no
well-preserved specimen, unless that at Pisa may be so regarded.
In the drawing of baths from the thermae of Titus (fig. 1), the
laconicum is represented as a small cupola rising in a corner of
the calidarium. It is known that the temperature of the laconicum
was regulated by drawing up or down a metallic plate or
<i>clypeus</i>. Some think that this clypeus was directly over the
flames of the hypocaustum, and that when it was withdrawn,
the flames must have sprung into the laconicum. Others, and
apparently they have Vitruvius on their side, think that the
clypeus was drawn up or down only from the aperture in the
roof, and that it regulated the temperature simply by giving
more or less free exit to the hot air. If the laconicum was only
one end of the calidarium, it is difficult to see how that end of
the room was kept so much hotter than the rest of it; on the
other hand, to have had flames actually issuing from the laconicum
must have caused smoke and soot, and have been very
unpleasant. The most usual order in which the rooms were
employed seems to have been the following, but there does not
appear to have been any absolute uniformity of practice then,
any more than in modern Egyptian and Turkish baths. Celsus
recommends the bather first to sweat a little in the tepidarium
with his clothes on, to be anointed there, and then to pass into
the calidarium; after he has sweated freely there he is not to
descend into the solium or cold bath, but to have plenty of water
poured over him from his head,&mdash;first warm, then tepid, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page515" id="page515"></a>515</span>
cold water&mdash;the water being poured longer over his head than
on the rest of the body; next to be scraped with the strigil, and
lastly to be rubbed and anointed.</p>

<p>The warmest of the heated rooms, <i>i.e.</i> the calidarium and
laconicum, were heated directly from the hypocaustum, over
which they were built or suspended (<i>suspensura</i>); while from the
hypocaustum tubes of brass, or lead, or pottery carried the hot
air or vapour to the walls of the other rooms. The walls were
usually hollow, so that the hot air could readily circulate.</p>

<p>The water was heated ingeniously. Close to the furnace, about
4 in. off, was placed the <i>calidarium</i>, the copper (<i>ahenum</i>) for
boiling water, near which, with the same interval between them,
was the copper for warm water, the <i>tepidarium</i>, and at the
distance of 2 ft. from this was the receptacle for cold water, or
the <i>frigidarium</i>, often a plastered reservoir. A constant communication
was kept up between these vessels, so that as fast as
hot water was drawn off from the calidarium a supply was obtained
from the tepidarium, which, being already heated, but slightly
reduced the temperature of the hotter boiler. The tepidarium,
again, was supplied from the frigidarium, and that from an
aqueduct. In this way the heat which was not taken up by the
first boiler passed on to the second, and instead of being wasted,
helped to heat the second&mdash;a principle which has only lately been
introduced into modern furnaces. In the case of the large thermae
the water of an aqueduct was brought to the <i>castellum</i> or top of
the building and was allowed to descend into chambers over the
hypocaustum, where it was heated and transmitted in pipes to the
central buildings. Remains of this arrangement are to be seen in
the baths of Caracalla. The general plan of such buildings may
be more clearly understood by the accompanying illustrations.
In the well-known drawing (fig. 1) found in the baths of Titus, the
name of each part of the building is inscribed on it. The small
dome inscribed laconicum directly over the furnace, and having
the clypeus over it, will be observed in the corner of the chamber
named concamerata sudatio. The vessels for water are inscribed,
according to their temperature, with the same names as some of
the chambers, frigidarium, tepidarium and calidarium.</p>

<p>The baths of Pompeii (as shown in fig. 2) were a double set, and
were surrounded with tabernae or shops, which are marked by a
lighter shade. There were streets on four sides; and the reservoir
supplying water was across the street in the building on the left
hand of the cut. There were three public entrances&mdash;21<i>a</i>, 21<i>b</i>,
21c&mdash;to the men&rsquo;s baths and one to the women&rsquo;s. The furnaces
(9) heated water, which was conveyed on one side to the larger
baths of the men, on the other to the women&rsquo;s. Entering from
the street at 21c there was a latrina on the left hand (22). From
this entrance it was usual to proceed to a court (20) surrounded by
pillars, where servants were in attendance. There is some doubt
as to the purpose to which the room (19) was devoted. Leaving
the hall a passage conducted to the apodyterium or dressing-room
(17), at one end of it is the frigidarium, baptisterium or cold
plunge bath (18). Entering out of the apodyterium is the
tepidarium or warming-room (15), which most probably was also
used as the alipterium or anointing-room. From it bathers
passed into the hot room or calidarium (12), which had at one end
the alveus or calida lavatio (13), at the other end the labrum (14).
This end of the calidarium served as the laconicum. The arrangements
of the women&rsquo;s baths were similar, but on a smaller scale.
The calidarium (5) had the labrum (7) at one end, and the alveus
(6) was in one side of the room. The general arrangements of a
calidarium are well illustrated by the accompanying section
(fig. 3) of a bath discovered at Tusculum. The disposition of the
parts is the same as at Pompeii. We here have the calidarium
supported on the pillars of the fornax, the suspensura. The alveus
(3) is at one end, and the labrum (4) at the other. (1) and (2)
are the vessels for water over
the fornax; and the passages
in the roof and walls for the
escape of heated air will be
observed.</p>

<p>A clear idea of the relative
position of the different rooms,
and some slight indication of
their ornamentation, will be
obtained from fig. 4. The
flues under the calidarium
and the labrum (1) may be
observed, as also the opening
in the roof above. (2), (3)
and (4) mark the vessels for water which are placed between the
men&rsquo;s baths on the left and the women&rsquo;s on the right.</p>

<p>The arrangements of the <i>thermae</i> were mainly those of the
balneae on a larger scale. Some idea of their size may be gathered
from such facts as these, that in the baths of Diocletian one room
has been transmuted into a church of most imposing proportions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page516" id="page516"></a>516</span>
and that the outside walls of the baths of Caracalla extend about a
quarter of a mile on each of the four sides. A visit to the remains
of the baths of Titus, of Diocletian, or of Caracalla impresses the
mind strongly with a sense of the vast scale on which they were
erected, and Ammianus&rsquo;s designation of them as provinces appears
scarcely exaggerated. It is said that the baths of Caracalla
contained 1600, and those of Diocletian 3200 marble seats for the
use of the bathers. In the largest of the thermae there was a
stadium for the games of the young men, with raised seats for the
spectators. There were open colonnades and seats for philosophers
and literary men to sit and discourse or read their
productions aloud or for others to discuss the latest news. Near
the porticoes, in the interior open space, rows of trees were
planted. There was a <i>sphaeristerium</i> or place for playing ball,
which was often over the apodyterium; but it must be confessed
that the purposes of many portions of these large edifices have not
been made out in as satisfactory a way as those of smaller baths.
A more definite idea of the thermae can be best got by an examination
of the accompanying plan of the baths of Caracalla (fig. 5).
A good deal of the plan is conjectural, the restorations being
marked by lighter shading.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>At the bottom of the plan is shown a long colonnade, which faces
the street, behind which was a series of chambers, supposed to have
been separate bathing-rooms. Entering by the opening in its centre,
the visitor passes what was probably an inner colonnade round the
main building. Passing in by either of the gates (2, 2), he reaches
the large chamber (3), which has been variously called the natatio
or large swimming-bath, or the tepidarium. The great central room
(4) in all probability was the calidarium, with two labra (6, 6) on
opposite sides, and with four alvei, one in each corner, represented
by small circular dots. (9) has been regarded by some as the laconicuim,
although it appears very large for that purpose. The rooms
(15, 15) have been variously described as baptisteria and as laconica.
Most authors are agreed in thinking that the large rooms (13) and
(16) were the sphaeristeria or places for playing ball.</p>

<p>Returning to the outside, (1) and (18) and the corresponding
places on the other side are supposed to have been the exedrae for
philosophers, and places corresponding to the Greek xysti. (20) and
(19) have been considered to be servants&rsquo; rooms. (22) was the
stadium, with raised seats for the spectators. The space between
this and the large central hall (9) was planted with trees, and at (21)
the aqueduct brought water into the castellum or reservoir, which
was on an upper storey. There were upper storeys in most portions of
the building, and in these probably were the libraries and small
theatres.</p>
</div>

<p>The piscinae were often of immense size&mdash;that of Diocletian
being 200 ft. long&mdash;and were adorned with beautiful marbles.
The halls were crowded with magnificent columns and were
ornamented with the finest pieces of statuary. The walls, it has
been said, were covered with exquisite mosaics that imitated the
art of the painter in their elegance of design and variety of colour.
The Egyptian syenite was encrusted with the precious green
marbles of Numidia. The rooms contained the works of Phidias
and Praxiteles. A perpetual stream of water was poured into
capacious basins through the wide mouths of lions of bright and
polished silver, water issued from silver, and was received on
silver. &ldquo;To such a pitch of luxury have we reached,&rdquo; says Seneca,
&ldquo;that we are dissatisfied if we do not tread on gems in our baths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The richer Romans used every variety of oils and pomades
(<i>smegmata</i>); they scarcely had true soaps. The poorer class had
to be content with the flour of lentils, an article used at this day
for the same purpose by Orientals. The most important bath
utensil was the strigillus, a curved instrument
made of metal, with which the skin
was scraped and all sordes removed.</p>

<p>The bath servants assisted in anointing,
in using the strigillus and in various other
menial offices. The poorer classes had to
use their strigils themselves. The various
processes of the aliptae seem to have been
carried on very systematically.</p>

<p>The hot baths appear to have been open
from 1 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> till dark. It was only one of
the later emperors that had them lighted
up at night. When the hot baths were
ready (for, doubtless, the plunge baths
were available at an earlier hour), a bell
or <i>aes</i> was rung for the information of the
people. Among the Greeks and Romans
the eighth hour, or 1 o&rsquo;clock, before their
dinner, was the commonest hour for bathing.
The bath was supposed to promote appetite,
and some voluptuaries had one or more
baths after dinner, to enable them to begin
eating again; but such excesses, as Juvenal tells us, occasionally
proved fatal. Some of the most effeminate of the emperors are
said to have bathed seven or eight times in the course of the
day. In early times there was delicacy of feeling about the
sexes bathing together&mdash;even a father could not bathe with his
sons; but latterly, under most of the emperors, men and women
often used the same baths. There frequently were separate
baths for the women, as we see at Pompeii or at Badenweiler;
but although respectable matrons would not go to public
baths, promiscuous bathing was common during the Empire.</p>

<p>The public baths and thermae were under the more immediate
superintendence of the aediles. The charge made at a public
bath was only a quadrans or quarter of an as, about half a
farthing. Yet cheap though this was, the emperors used to
ingratiate themselves with the populace, by making the baths
at times gratuitous.</p>

<p>Wherever the Romans settled, they built public baths; and
wherever they found hot springs or natural stufae, they made
use of them, thus saving the expense of heating, as at the <i>myrteta</i>
of Baiae or the <i>Aquae Sulis</i> of Bath. In the cities there appear
to have been private baths for hire, as well as the public baths;
and every rich citizen had a set of baths attached to his villa,
the fullest account of which is given in the <i>Letters</i> of Pliny,
or in Ausonius&rsquo;s <i>Account of a Villa on the Moselle</i>, or in Statius&rsquo;s
<i>De Balneo Etrusco</i>. Although the Romans never wholly gave
up cold bathing, and that practice was revived under Augustus
by Antonius Musa, and again under Nero by Charmis (at which
later time bathing in the open sea became common), yet they
chiefly practised warm bathing (<i>calida lavatio</i>). This is the
most luxurious kind of bathing, and when indulged in to excess
is enervating. The women were particularly fond of these baths,
and were accused, at all events in some provincial cities, of
drunkenness in them.</p>

<p>The unbounded license of the public baths, and their connexion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page517" id="page517"></a>517</span>
with modes of amusement that were condemned, led to their
being to a considerable extent proscribed by the early Christians.
The early Fathers wrote that bathing might be practised for the
sake of cleanliness or of health, but not of pleasure; and Gregory
the Great saw no objection to baths being used on Sunday.
About the 5th century many of the large thermae in Rome fell
into decay. The cutting off of the aqueducts by the Huns,
and the gradual decrease of the population, contributed to this.
Still it is doubtful whether bathing was ever disused to the extent
that is usually represented. It was certainly kept up in the
East in full vigour at Alexandria and at Brusa. Hot bathing,
and especially hot air and vapour baths, were adopted by the
Mahommedans; and the Arabs brought them with them into
Spain. The Turks, at a later time, carried them high up the
Danube, and the Mahommedans spread or, it may be more
correct to say, revived their use in Persia and in Hindustan.
The Crusaders also contributed to the spread of baths in Europe,
and hot vapour baths were specially recommended for the leprosy
so prevalent in those days. After the commencement of the 13th
century there were few large cities in Europe without hot vapour
baths. We have full accounts of their regulations&mdash;how the
Jews were only allowed to visit them once a week, and how there
were separate baths for lepers. In England they were called
hothouses. Erasmus, at the date of the Reformation, spoke
of them as common in France, Germany and Belgium; he gives
a lively account of the mixture of all classes of people to be found
in them, and would imply that they were a common adjunct to
inns. They seem after a time to have become less common,
though Montaigne mentions them as being still in Rome in his
day. In England the next revival of baths was at the close of
the 17th century, under the Eastern name of <i>Hummums</i> or the
Italian name of Bagnios. These were avowedly on the principle
of the Turkish baths described below. But there were several
considerable epochs in the history of baths, one in the commencement
of the 18th century, when Floyer and others recalled
attention to cold bathing, of which the virtues had long been
overlooked. In the middle of the century also, Russell and
others revived sea-bathing in England, and were followed by
others on the continent, until the value of sea-bathing became
fully appreciated. Later in the same century the experiments
of James Currie on the action of complete or of partial baths
on the system in disease attracted attention; and though forgotten
for a while, they bore abundant fruit in more recent
times.</p>

<p><i>Modern Baths</i>.&mdash;It is uncertain how far the Turkish and
Egyptian and even the Russian baths are to be regarded merely
as successors of the Roman baths, because the principle of
vapour baths has been known to many nations in a very early
period of civilization. Thus the Mexicans and Indians were
found using small vapour baths. The ancient inhabitants of
Ireland and of Scotland had some notion of their use, and the
large vapour baths of Japan, now so extensively employed,
are probably of independent origin.</p>

<p>The following accounts of Turkish and Russian baths illustrate
the practices of the ancient Roman and also of modern Turkish
baths. In Lane&rsquo;s <i>On the Modern Egyptians</i> we read: &ldquo;The
building consists of several apartments, all of which are paved
with marble, chiefly white. The inner apartments are covered
with domes, which have a number of small glazed apertures
for the admission of light. The bather, on entering, if he has
a watch or purse, gives them in charge to the keeper of the bath.
The servant of the bath takes off his shoes and supplies him
with a pair of wooden clogs. The first apartment has generally
three or four <i>leewans</i> (raised parts of the floor used as couches)
cased with marble, and a fountain of cold water, which rises
from an octagonal basement in the centre. One of the leewans,
which is meant for the higher classes, is furnished with cushions
or mats. In warm weather bathers usually undress in this
room; in winter they undress in an inner room, called the
<i>beytowwal</i> or first chamber, between which and the last apartment
there is a passage often with two or three latrines off it.
This is the first of the heated chambers. It generally has two
raised seats. The bather receives a napkin in which to put his
clothes and another to put round his waist&mdash;this reaches to the
knees; a third, if he requires it, is brought him to wind round
his head, leaving the top of it bare; a fourth to put over his
chest; and a fifth to cover his back. When the bather has undressed,
the attendant opens to him the door of the inner and
principal apartment. This in general has four leewans, which
gives it the form of a cross, and in the centre a fountain of hot
water rises from a small shallow basin. The centre room, with
the adjoining ones, forms almost a square. The beytowwal
already mentioned is one of them. Two small chambers which
adjoin each other, one containing a tank of hot water, the other
containing a trough, over which are two taps, one of hot and one
of cold water, occupy the two other angles; while the fourth
angle of the square is occupied by the chamber which contains
the fire, over which is the boiler. The bather having entered
this apartment soon perspires profusely from the humid heat
which is produced by the hot water of tanks and fountains, and
by the steam of the boiler. The bather sits on one of the marble
seats, or lies on the leewan or near one of the tanks, and the
operator then commences his work. The operator first cracks
aloud every joint in the body. He makes the vertebrae of the
back and even of the neck crack. The limbs are twisted with
apparent violence, but so skilfully, that no harm is ever done.
The operator next kneads the patient&rsquo;s flesh. After this he rubs
the soles of the feet with a kind of rasp of baked clay. There
are two kinds of rasps, one porous and rough, one of fine smooth
clay. Those used by ladies are usually encased in thin embossed
silver. The next operation is rubbing the bather&rsquo;s flesh with a
small coarse woollen bag, after which the bather dips himself
in one of the tanks. He is next taken to one of the chambers
in the corner, and the operator lathers the bather with fibres of
the palm tree, soap and water. The soap is then washed off with
water, when the bather having finished washing, and enveloped
himself in dry towels, returns to the beytowwal and reclines.
Here he generally remains an hour to an hour and a half, sipping
coffee and smoking, while an attendant rubs the soles of the
feet and kneads the body and limbs. The bather then dresses
and goes out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following description of a Russian bath is from Kohl&rsquo;s
<i>Russia</i> (1842): &ldquo;The passage from the door is divided into two
behind the check-taker&rsquo;s post, one for the male, one for the female
guests. We first enter an open space, in which a set of men are
sitting in a state of nudity on benches, those who have already
bathed dressing, while those who are going to undergo the process
take off their clothes. Round this space or apartment are
the doors leading to the vapour-rooms. The bather is ushered
into them, and finds himself in a room full of vapour, which is
surrounded by a wooden platform rising in steps to near the roof
of the room. The bather is made to lie down on one of the lower
benches, and gradually to ascend to the higher and hotter ones.
The first sensation on entering the room amounts almost to a
feeling of suffocation. After you have been subjected for some
time to a temperature which may rise to 145° the transpiration
reaches its full activity, and the sensation is very pleasant.
The bath attendants come and flog you with birchen twigs,
cover you with the lather of soap, afterwards rub it off, and then
hold you over a jet of ice-cold water. The shock is great, but is
followed by a pleasant feeling of great comfort and of alleviation
of any rheumatic pains you may have had. In regular establishments
you go after this and lie down on a bed for a time before
issuing forth. But the Russians often dress in the open air, and
instead of using the jet of cold water, go and roll themselves at
once in the snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turkish baths have, with various modifications, become
popular in Europe. The Russian baths were introduced into
German towns about 1825. They had a certain limited amount
of popularity, but did not take firm root. Another class practically
owes its origin to Dr Barter and David Urquhart. It professed
to be founded on the Turkish bath, but in reality it was
much more of a hot air bath, <i>i.e.</i> more devoid of vapour than
either Roman or Turkish baths ever were, for it is doubtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>518</span>
whether in any case the air of the laconicum was free from
vapour. These baths, with their various modifications, have
become extremely popular in Great Britain, in Germany and in
northern Europe, but have, curiously enough, never been used
extensively in France, notwithstanding the familiarity of the
French with Turkish baths in Algiers.</p>

<p>In England hot air baths are now employed very extensively.
They are often associated with Turkish and electric baths.</p>

<p>Bathing among the ancients was practised in various forms.
It was sometimes a simple bath in cold or in tepid water; but
at least, in the case of the higher orders, it usually included a
hot air or vapour bath, and was followed by affusion of cold or
warm water, and generally by a plunge into the piscina. In like
manner the order varies in which the different processes are gone
through in Turkish baths in modern Europe. Thus in the baths
in Vienna, the process begins by immersion in a large basin of
warm water. Sudation is repeatedly interrupted by cold douches
at the will of the bathers, and after the bath they are satisfied
with a short stay in the cooling-room, where they have only a
simple sheet rolled round them. In Copenhagen and in Stockholm
the Oriental baths have been considerably modified by
their association with hydropathic practices.</p>

<p>This leads us to notice the introduction of the curiously misnamed
system known as hydropathy (<i>q.v.</i>). Although cold
baths were in vogue for a time in Rome, warm baths were always
more popular. Floyer, as we have seen, did something to revive
their use in England; but it was nearly a century and a half
afterwards that a Silesian peasant, Priessnitz, introduced, with
wonderful success, a variety of operations with cold water, the
most important of which was the packing the patient in a wet
sheet, a process which after a time is followed by profuse sudation.
Large establishments for carrying out this mode of bathing
and its modifications were erected in many places on the continent
and in Great Britain, and enjoyed at one time a large
share of popularity. The name &ldquo;hydropathic&rdquo; is still retained
for these establishments, though hydropathy so-called is no
longer practised within them to any extent.</p>

<p>But the greatest and most important development of ordinary
baths in modern times was in England, though it has extended
gradually to some parts of the continent. The English had long
used affusion and swimming-baths freely in India. Cold and hot
baths and shower baths have been introduced into private
houses to an extent never known before; and, since 1842, public
swimming-baths, besides separate baths, have been supplied
to the public at very moderate rates, in some cases associated
with wash-houses for the poorer classes. Their number has
increased rapidly in London and in the principal continental
cities. Floating-baths in rivers, always known in some German
towns, have become common wherever there are flowing streams.
The better supply of most European cities with water has aided
in this movement. Ample enclosed swimming-baths have been
erected at many seaside places. When required, the water, if
not heated in a boiler, is raised to a sufficient temperature by
the aid of hot water pipes or of steam. Separate baths used to
be of wood, painted; they are now most frequently of metal,
painted or lined with <span class="correction" title="amended from procelain">porcelain</span> enamel. The swimming-baths
are lined with cement, tiles or marble and porcelain slabs; and
a good deal of ornamentation and painting of the walls and
ceiling of the apartments, in imitation of the ancients, has been
attempted.</p>

<p>We have thus traced in outline the history of baths through
successive ages. The medium of the baths spoken of thus far
has been water, vapour or dry hot air. But baths of more
complex nature, and of the greatest variety, have been in use
from the earliest ages. The best known media are the various
mineral waters and sea-water. Of baths of <i>mineral</i> substances,
those of sand are the oldest and best known; the practice of
<i>arenation</i> or of burying the body in the sand of the sea-shore,
or in heated sand near some hot spring, is very ancient, as also
that of applying heated sand to various parts of the body.
Baths of <i>peat</i> earth are of comparatively recent origin. The
peat earth is carefully prepared and pulverized, and then worked
up with water into a pasty consistence, of which the temperature
can be regulated before the patient immerses himself in it.</p>

<p>There are various terms that may be termed <i>chemical</i>, in which
chlorine or hydrochloric acid is added to the water of the bath,
or where fumes of sulphur are made to rise and envelop the body.</p>

<p>Of <i>vegetable</i> baths the number is very large. Lees of wine, in a
state of fermentation, have been employed. An immense variety
of aromatic herbs have been used to impregnate water with.
At one time fuci or sea-weed were added to baths, under the idea
of conveying into the system the iodine which they contain;
but by far the most popular of all vegetable baths are those
made with an extract got by distilling certain varieties of pine
leaves.</p>

<p>The strangeness of the baths of <i>animal</i> substances, that have
been at various times in use, is such that their employment
seems scarcely credible. That baths of milk or of whey might
be not unpopular is not surprising, but baths of blood, in some
cases even of human blood, have been used; and baths of horse
dung were for many ages in high favour, and were even succeeded
for a short time by baths of guano.</p>

<p><i>Electrical</i> baths are now largely used, a current being passed
through the water; and electrical <i>massage</i>, by the d&rsquo;Arsonval or
other system, is colloquially termed a &ldquo;bath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baths also of <i>compressed air</i>, in which the patient is subjected
to the pressure of two or three atmospheres, were formerly
employed in some places.</p>

<p>A <i>sun</i> bath (<i>insolatio</i> or <i>heliosis</i>), exposing the body to the sun,
the head being covered, was a favourite practice among the
Greeks and Romans.</p>

<p>Some special devices require a few words of explanation.</p>

<p><i>Douches</i> were used by the ancients, and have always been an
important mode of applying water to a circumscribed portion of
the body. They are, in fact, spouts of water, varying in size and
temperature, applied by a hose-pipe with more or less force for
a longer or shorter time against particular parts. A douche
exercises a certain amount of friction, and a continued impulse
on the spot to which it is applied, which stimulate the skin and
the parts beneath it, quickening the capillary circulation. The
effects of the douche are so powerful that it cannot be applied
for more than a few minutes continuously. The alternation of
hot and cold douches, which for some unknown reason has got
the name of <i>Écossaise</i>, is a very potent type of bath from the
strong action and reaction which it produces. The <i>shower</i> bath
may be regarded as a union of an immense number of fine douches
projected on the head and shoulders. It produces a strong effect
on the nervous system. An ingenious contrivance for giving
circular <i>spray</i> baths, by which water is propelled laterally in
fine streams against every portion of the surface of the body, is
now common.</p>

<p>To all these modes of acting on the cutaneous surface and
circulation must be added dry rubbing, as practised by the
patient with the flesh glove, but much more thoroughly by the
bath attendants, if properly instructed (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Massage</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Action of Baths on the Human System</i>.&mdash;The primary operation
of baths is the action of heat and cold on the cutaneous surfaces
through the medium of water.</p>

<p>The first purpose of baths is simply that of abstersion and
cleanliness, to remove any foreign impurity from the surface, and
to prevent the pores from being clogged by their own secretions
or by desquamations of cuticle. It need scarcely be said that such
objects are greatly promoted by the action of the alkali of soaps
and by friction; that the use of warm water, owing to its immediate
stimulation of the skin, promotes the separation of sordes,
and that the vapour of water is still more efficient than water
itself.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that water acts on the system by being
absorbed through the skin, but, under ordinary circumstances, no
water is absorbed, or, if any, so minute a quantity as not to be
worth considering. No dissolved substances, under the ordinary
circumstances of a bath, are actually absorbed into the system;
although when a portion of skin has been entirely cleared of its
sebaceous secretion, it is possible that a strong solution of salts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page519" id="page519"></a>519</span>
may be partially absorbed. In the case of medicated baths we
therefore only look (in addition to the action of heat and cold, or
more properly to the abstraction or communication and retention
of heat) to any stimulant action on the skin that the ingredients
of the bath may possess.</p>

<p>The powerful influence of water on the capillaries of the skin,
and the mode and extent of that operation, depend primarily on
the temperature of the fluid. The human system bears changes of
temperature of the air much better than changes of the temperature
of water. While the temperature of the air at 75° may be too
warm for the feelings of many people, a continued bath at that
temperature is felt to be cold and depressing. Again, a bath of
98° to 102° acts far more excitingly than air of the same temperature,
both because, being a better conductor, water brings more
heat to the body and because it suppresses the perspiration which
is greatly augmented by air of that temperature. Further, a
temperature a few degrees below blood heat is that of indifferent
baths, which can be borne longest without natural disturbance of
the system.</p>

<p><i>Cold baths</i> act by refrigeration, and their effects vary
according to the degree of temperature. The effects of a cold bath, the
temperature not being below 50°, are these:&mdash;there is a diminution
of the temperature of the skin and of the subjacent tissues;
there is a certain feeling of shock diffused over the whole surface,
and if the cold is intense it induces a slight feeling of numbness
in the skin. It becomes pale and its capillaries contract. The
further action of a cold bath reaches the central nervous system,
the heart and the lungs, as manifested by the tremor of the limbs
it produces, along with a certain degree of oppression of the chest
and a gasping for air, while the pulse becomes small and sinks.
After a time reaction takes place, and brings redness to the skin
and an increase of temperature.</p>

<p>The colder the water is, and the more powerful and depressing
its effects, the quicker and more active is the reaction. Very cold
baths, anything below 50°, cannot be borne long. Lowering of
the temperature of the skin may be borne down to 9°, but a further
reduction may prove fatal. The diminution of temperature is
much more rapid when the water is in motion, or when the bather
moves about; because, if the water is still, the layer of it in
immediate contact with the body is warmed to a certain degree.</p>

<p>A great deal depends on the form of the cold bath; thus one
may have&mdash;(1) Its depressing operation,&mdash;with a loss of heat,
retardation of the circulation, and feeling of weariness, when the
same water remains in contact with the skin, and there is continuous
withdrawal of heat without fresh stimulation. This occurs
with full or sitz baths, with partial or complete wrapping up the
body in a wet sheet which remains unchanged, and with frictions
practised without removing the wet sheets. (2) Its exciting
operation,&mdash;with quickening of the action of the heart and lungs,
and feeling of glow and of nervous excitement and of increased
muscular power. These sensations are produced when the layer
of water next the body and heated by it is removed, and fresh cold
water causes fresh stimulus. These effects are produced by full
baths with the water in motion used only for a short time, by
frictions when the wet sheet is removed from the body, by douches,
shower baths, bathing in rivers, &amp;c. The depressing operation
comes on much earlier in very cold water than in warmer; and in
the same way the exciting operation comes on faster with the
colder than with the warmer water. The short duration of the bath
makes both its depressing and its exciting action less; its longer
duration increases them; and if the baths be continued too long,
the protracted abstraction of animal heat may prove very depressing.</p>

<p><i>Tepid baths,</i> 85° to 95°.&mdash;The effects of a bath of this
temperature are confined to the peripheral extremities of the nerves,
and are so slight that they do not reach the central system.
There is no reaction, and the body temperature remains unchanged.
Baths of this kind can be borne for hours with impunity.</p>

<p><i>Warm baths</i> from 96° to 104°.&mdash;In these the action of the heat
on the peripheral surface is propagated to the central system, and
causes reaction, which manifests itself in moderately increased flow
of the blood to the surface, and in an increased frequency of pulse.</p>

<p>With a <i>hot bath</i> from 102° up to 110° the central nervous and
circulating systems are more affected. The frequency of the pulse
increases rapidly, the respiration becomes quickened, and is
interrupted by deep inspirations. The skin is congested, and
there is profuse perspiration.</p>

<p><i>Very hot baths.</i>&mdash;Everything above 110° feels very hot;
anything above 120° almost scalding. Baths of from 119° to 126°
have caused a rise of 2° to 4½° in the temperature of the blood.
Such a bath can be borne for only a few minutes. It causes great
rapidity of the pulse, extreme lowering of the blood-pressure,
excessive congestion of the skin, and violent perspiration.</p>

<p>In the use of hot baths a certain amount of vapour reaches the
parts of the body not covered by the water, and is also inhaled.</p>

<p><i>Vapour</i> baths produce profuse perspiration and act in
cleansing the skin, as powerful hot water baths do. Vapour, owing to
its smaller specific heat, does not act so fast as water on the body.
A vapour bath can be borne for a much longer time when the
vapour is not inhaled. Vapour baths can be borne hotter than
water baths, but cannot be continued too long, as vapour, being a
bad conductor, prevents radiation of heat from the body. A
higher heat than 122° is not borne comfortably. The vapour bath
though falling considerably short of the temperature of the hot
air bath, raises the temperature much more.</p>

<p><i>Hot air</i> baths differ from vapour baths in not impeding the
respiration as the latter do, by depositing moisture in the bronchial
tubes. The lungs, instead of having to heat the inspired air,
are subjected to a temperature above their own. Hot air baths,
say of 135°, produce more profuse perspiration than vapour baths.
If very hot, they raise the temperature of the body by several
degrees. Vapour baths, hot air baths, and hot water baths agree
in producing violent perspiration. As perspiration eliminates
water and effete matter from the system, it is obvious that its
regulation must have an important effect on the economy.</p>

<p>In comparing the general effects of cold and hot baths, it may
be said that while the former tend to check perspiration, the
latter favour it.</p>

<p>The warm bath causes swelling and congestion of the capillaries
of the surface in the first instance; when the stimulus of heat is
withdrawn their contraction ensues. A cold bath, again, first
causes a contraction of the capillaries of the surface, which is
followed by their expansion when reaction sets in. A warm bath
elevates the temperature of the body, both by bringing a supply
of heat to it and by preventing the radiation of heat from it.
It can be borne longer than a cold bath. It draws blood to the
surface, while a cold bath favours internal congestions.</p>

<p>But baths often produce injurious effects when used injudiciously.
Long continued warm baths are soporific, and have, owing to
this action, often caused death by drowning. The effects of
very hot baths are swimming in the head, vomiting, fainting,
congestion of the brain, and, in some instances, apoplexy.</p>

<p>The symptoms seem to point to paralysis of the action of the
heart. It is therefore very evident how cautious those should be,
in the use of hot baths, who have weak hearts or any obstruction
to the circulation. Fat men, and those in whom the heart or
blood-vessels are unsound, should avoid them. Protracted
indulgence in warm baths is relaxing, and has been esteemed a
sign of effeminacy in all ages. Sleepiness, though it will not
follow the first immersion in a cold bath, is one of the effects
of protracted cold baths; depression of the temperature of the
surface becomes dangerous. The risk in cold baths is congestion
of the internal organs, as often indicated by the lips getting blue.
Extremely cold baths are always dangerous.</p>

<p><i>Public Baths.</i>&mdash;It was not till 1846 that it was deemed
advisable in England, for the &ldquo;health, comfort, and welfare&rdquo; of
the inhabitants of towns and populous districts, to encourage
the establishment therein of baths by the local authority acting
through commissioners. A series of statutes, known collectively
as &ldquo;The Baths and Wash-houses Acts 1846 to 1896,&rdquo; followed.
By the Public Health Act 1875, the urban authority was declared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page520" id="page520"></a>520</span>
to be the authority having power to adopt and proceed under
the previous acts, and in 1878 provision was for the first time
expressly made for the establishment of swimming baths, which
might be used during the winter as gymnasia, and by an
amending act of 1899, for music or dancing, provided a licence
is obtained. By the Local Government Act 1894, it was provided
that the parish meeting should be the authority having exclusive
power of adopting the Baths and Wash-houses Acts in rural
districts, which should, if adopted, be carried into effect by the
parish council. Up to 1865 it seems as if only twenty-five
boroughs had cared to provide bathing accommodation for their
inhabitants. There is no complete information as to the number
of authorities who have adopted the acts since 1865, but a return
of reproductive undertakings presented to the House of Commons
in 1899 shows that no local authorities outside the metropolis
applied for power to raise loans to provide baths, of whom 48
applied before 1875 and 62 after 1875. In the year 1907 the
loans sanctioned for the purpose amounted to £53,026. The
revenues of parish councils are so limited that it has not been
possible for them to take much advantage of the acts. In the
metropolis, by the Local Government Act of 1894, the power
of working the act was given to vestries, and by the act of
1899 this power was transferred to the borough councils. There
are 35 parishes in London in which the acts have been adopted,
all of which except 11 have taken action since 1875. These
establishments, according to the return made in 1908, provided
3502 private baths and 104 swimming baths. The maximum
charge for a second-class cold bath is 1d., for a hot bath 2d.
In 1904-1905 the number of bathers was 6,342,158, of whom
3,064,998 were bathers in private baths and 3,277,160 bathers
in swimming baths. In 1896-1897 the gross total had been
only 2,000,000. In cases where the proportion between the sexes
has been worked out, it is found that only 18% of the users of
private baths, and 10% of the users of swimming baths, are
females. In 1898 the School Board was authorized to pay the
fees for children using the baths if instruction in swimming
were provided, and in 1907-1908 the privilege was used by
1,556,542 children. The cost of this public provision in London&mdash;water
being supplied by measure&mdash;is over £80,000 a year. No
account can be given of the numbers using the ponds and lakes
in the parks and open spaces, but it is computed that on a hot
Sunday 25,000 people bathe in Victoria Park, London, some of
the bathers starting as early as four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
These returns show how great is the increase of the habit of
bathing, but they also show how even now the habit is limited
to a comparatively small part of the population. People require
to be tempted to the use of water, at any rate at the beginning.
There are still authorities in London responsible for 800,000
persons who have provided no baths, and those who have
made provision have not always done so in a sufficiently
liberal and tempting way. The comparison between English
great towns and those of the continent is not in favour of the
former.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATHURST, EARLS.<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> <span class="sc">Allen Bathurst</span>, 1st Earl Bathurst
(1684-1775), was the eldest son of Sir Benjamin Bathurst
(d. 1704), by his wife, Frances (d. 1727), daughter of Sir Allen
Apsley of Apsley, Sussex, and belonged to a family which is said
to have settled in Sussex before the Norman Conquest. He was
educated at Trinity College, Oxford, and became member of
parliament for Cirencester in May 1705, retaining his seat until
December 1711, when he was created Baron Bathurst of Battlesden,
Bedfordshire. As a zealous Tory he defended Atterbury,
bishop of Rochester, and in the House of Lords was an opponent
of Sir Robert Walpole. After Walpole left office in 1742 he was
made a privy councillor, and in August 1772 was created Earl
Bathurst, having previously received a pension of £2000 a year
chargeable upon the Irish revenues. He died on the 16th of
September 1775, and was buried in Cirencester church. In July
1704 Bathurst married his cousin, Catherine (d. 1768), daughter
of Sir Peter Apsley, by whom he had four sons and five daughters.
The earl associated with the poets and scholars of the time.
Pope, Swift, Prior, Sterne, and Congreve were among his friends.
He is described in Sterne&rsquo;s <i>Letters to Eliza</i>; was the subject of a
graceful reference on the part of Burke speaking in the House of
Commons; and the letters which passed between him and Pope
are published in Pope&rsquo;s <i>Works</i>, vol. viii. (London, 1872).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Henry</span>, 2nd Earl Bathurst (1714-1794), was the eldest
surviving son of the 1st earl. Educated at Balliol College,
Oxford, he was called to the bar, and became a K.C. in 1745.
In April 1735 he had been elected member of parliament for
Cirencester, and was rewarded for his opposition to the government
by being made solicitor-general and then attorney-general
to Frederick, prince of Wales. Resigning his seat in parliament
in April 1754 he was made a judge of the court of common pleas
in the following month, and became lord high chancellor in
January 1771, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron
Apsley. Having become Earl Bathurst by his father&rsquo;s death in
September 1775, he resigned his office somewhat unwillingly in
July 1778 to enable Thurlow to join the cabinet of Lord North.
In November 1779 he was appointed lord president of the
council, and left office with North in March 1782. He died at
Oakley Grove near Cirencester on the 6th of August 1794.
Bathurst was twice married, and left two sons and four daughters.
He was a weak lord chancellor, but appears to have been just
and fair in his distribution of patronage.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Henry</span>, 3rd Earl Bathurst (1762-1834), the elder son of the
second earl, was born on the 22nd of May 1762. In April 1789
he married Georgiana (d. 1841), daughter of Lord George Henry
Lennox, and was member of parliament for Cirencester from
1783 until he succeeded to the earldom in August 1794. Owing
mainly to his friendship with William Pitt, he was a lord of the
admiralty from 1783 to 1789; a lord of the treasury from 1789
to 1791; and commissioner of the board of control from 1793
to 1802. Returning to office with Pitt in May 1804 he became
master of the mint, and was president of the Board of Trade and
master of the mint during the ministries of the duke of Portland
and Spencer Perceval, only vacating these posts in June 1812
to become secretary for war and the colonies under the earl of
Liverpool. For two months during the year 1809 he was in
charge of the foreign office. He was secretary for war and the
colonies until Liverpool resigned in April 1827; and deserves
some credit for improving the conduct of the Peninsular War,
while it was his duty to defend the government concerning its
treatment of Napoleon Bonaparte. Bathurst&rsquo;s official position
caused his name to be mentioned frequently during the agitation
for the abolition of slavery, and with regard to this traffic he
seems to have been animated by a humane spirit. He was lord
president of the council in the government of the duke of Wellington
from 1828 to 1830, and favoured the removal of the disabilities
of Roman Catholics, but was a sturdy opponent of the
reform bill of 1832. The earl, who had four sons and two
daughters, died on the 27th of July 1834. Bathurst was made a
knight of the Garter in 1817, and held several lucrative
sinecures.</p>

<p>His eldest son, <span class="sc">Henry George</span>, 4th Earl Bathurst (1790-1866),
was member of parliament for Cirencester from 1812 to
1834. He died unmarried on the 25th of May 1866, and was
succeeded in the title by his brother, <span class="sc">William Lennox</span>, 5th Earl
Bathurst (1791-1878), member of parliament for Weobley from
1812 to 1816, and clerk of the privy council from 1827 to 1860,
who died unmarried on the 24th of February 1878.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Allen Alexander</span>. 6th Earl Bathurst (1832-1892), was the
son of Thomas Seymour Bathurst, and grandson of the 3rd earl.
He was member of parliament for Cirencester from 1857 until he
became Earl Bathurst in February 1878, and died on the 2nd of
August 1892, when his eldest son, <span class="sc">Seymour Henry</span> (b. 1864),
became 7th Earl Bathurst.</p>

Australia, 144 m. by rail W.N.W. of Sydney on the Great
Western railway. Pop. (1901) 9223. It is situated on the south
bank of the Macquarie river, at an elevation of 2153 ft., in a
fertile undulating plain on the west side of the Blue Mountains.
Bathurst has broad streets,, crossing one another at right angles,
with a handsome park in the centre of the town, while many of
the public buildings, specially the town hall, government buildings,
and Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, are noteworthy.
Bathurst is the centre of the chief wheat-growing
district of New South Wales, while gold, copper and silver are
extensively mined in its vicinity. There are railway works,
coach factories, tanneries, breweries, flour-mills and manufactures
of boots and shoes and other commodities. The town
was founded in 1815 by Governor Macquarie, taking its name
from the 3rd Earl Bathurst, then secretary of state for the
colonies, and it has been a municipality since 1862.</p>

30,321. Area 2039 acres. The church of All Saints is mainly
Perpendicular, and contains some fine woodwork, mostly of the
17th century, and some good memorial tombs. The market
square contains an excellent group of modern buildings, including
the town hall, public library, post office and others. The town is
a centre of the heavy woollen trade, and has extensive manufactures
of army cloths, pilot cloths, druggets, flushings, &amp;c.
The working up of old material as &ldquo;shoddy&rdquo; is largely carried on.
There are also iron foundries, manufactures of machinery, and
stone quarries. The town lies on the south-west Yorkshire
coalfield, and there are a number of collieries in the district.

art from the intense mannerism into which it had fallen during
the preceding century. His paintings, however, are not of the

<p><span class="bold">BATON ROUGE,<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> the capital of Louisiana, U.S.A., and of
East Baton Rouge parish, on the E. bank of the Mississippi river,
about 70 m. N.W. of New Orleans. Pop. (1890) 10,478; (1900)
11,269, of whom 6596 were of negro descent; (1910 census)
14,897. It is served by the Yazoo &amp; Mississippi Valley railway
and by the Louisiana Railway &amp; Navigation Company; and
the Texas &amp; Pacific enters Port Alien, just across the river.
The city lies on the river bluff, secure against the highest floods.
Old houses in the Spanish style give quaintness to its appearance.
The state capitol was built in 1880-1882, replacing another
burned in 1862. At Baton Rouge is the State University and
Agricultural and Mechanical College (1860), of which the
Audubon Sugar School, &ldquo;for the highest scientific training
in the growing of sugar cane and in the technology of sugar
manufacture,&rdquo; is an important and distinctive feature. The
university grew out of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning
and Military Academy, founded in 1855 near Alexandria and
opened in 1860 under the charge of W.T. Sherman. In 1869 the
institution was removed to Baton Rouge, and in 1877 it was
united with the Agricultural and Mechanical College, established
in 1873 and in 1874 opened at New Orleans. The campus of
the university is the former barracks of the Baton Rouge garrison,
occupied by the college since 1886 and transferred to it by the
Federal government in 1902. The enrolment of the university
in 1907-1908 was 636. Other important institutions at Baton
Rouge are a State Agricultural Experiment Station, asylums
and schools for the deaf and dumb, for the blind, and for orphans,
and the state penitentiary. The surrounding bluff and alluvial
country is very rich. Sugar and cotton plantations and sub-tropic
fruit orchards occupy the front-lands on the river. The
manufactures include lumber and cotton seed products, and
sugar. The value of the city&rsquo;s factory products increased from
$717,368 in 1900 to $1,383,061 in 1905 or 92.8%. The city
is governed under a charter granted by the legislature in 1898.
This charter is peculiar in that it gives to the city council the
power to elect various administrative boards&mdash;of police, finance,
&amp;c.&mdash;from which the legislative council of most cities is separated.</p>

<p>Baton Rouge was one of the earliest French settlements in
the state. As a part of West Florida, it passed into the hands
of the British in 1763, and in 1779 was captured by Bernardo
Galvez, the Spanish governor of Louisiana. The town was
incorporated in 1817. In 1849 it was made the state capital,
remaining so until 1862, when Shreveport became the Confederate
state capital. In 1864 the Unionists made New Orleans
the seat of government. The Secession Ordinance of Louisiana
was passed on the 26th of January 1861 by a convention that
met at Baton Rouge. On the and of May 1862 the city was
captured by the forces of the United States under Col. Benjamin
H. Grierson (b. 1826), who had led raiders thither from
Tennessee; on the 12th of May it was formally occupied by
troops from New Orleans, and was successfully defended by
Brig.-Gen. Thomas Williams (1815-1862) against an attack
by Confederate forces under General John C. Breckinridge on
the 5th of August 1862; Gen. Williams, however, was killed
during the attack. Baton Rouge was soon abandoned for a
month, was then reoccupied, and was held throughout the rest
of the war. It became the state capital again in 1882, in accordance
with the state constitution of 1879. For several years
after 1840 Zachary Taylor made his home on a plantation near
Baton Rouge.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATRACHIA<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span>. The arguments adduced by T.H. Huxley,
in his article on this subject in the ninth edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</i>, for applying the name <i>Amphibia</i> to those
lung-breathing, pentadactyle vertebrates which had been first
severed from the Linnaean Amphibia by Alexandre Brongniart,
under the name of <i>Batrachia</i>, have not met with universal
acceptance. Although much used in text-books and anatomical
works in Great Britain and in Germany, the former name has
been discarded in favour of the latter by the principal authors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page522" id="page522"></a>522</span>
on systematic herpetology, such as W. Peters, A. Günther and
E.D. Cope, and their lead is followed in the present article.
Bearing in mind that Linnaeus, in his use of the name Amphibia,
was not alluding to the gill-breathing and air-breathing periods
through which most frogs and newts pass in the course of their
existence, but only wished to convey the fact that many of the
constituents of the group resort to both land and water (<i>e.g.</i>
crocodiles), it seems hard to admit that the term may be thus
diverted from its original signification, especially when such a
change results in discarding the name expressly proposed by
Brongniart to denote the association which has ever since been
universally adopted either as an order, a sub-class or a class.
Many authors who have devoted special attention to questions
of nomenclature therefore think <i>Reptilia</i> and <i>Batrachia</i> the
correct names of the two great classes into which the Linnaean
<i>Amphibia</i> have been divided, and consider that the latter term
should be reserved for the use of those who, like that great
authority, the late Professor Peters, down to the time of his death
in 1883, would persist in regarding reptiles and batrachians as
mere sub-classes (1). However extraordinary it may appear,
especially to those who bring the living forms only into focus,
that opposition should still be made to Huxley&rsquo;s primary division
of the vertebrates other than mammals into <i>Sauropsida</i> (birds
and reptiles) and <i>Ichthyopsida</i> (batrachians and fishes), it is
certain that recent discoveries in palaeontology have reduced
the gap between batrachians and reptiles to such a minimum
as to cause the greatest embarrassment in the attempt to draw
a satisfactory line of separation between the two; on the other
hand the hiatus between fishes and batrachians remains as wide
as it was at the time Huxley&rsquo;s article Amphibia (<i>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</i>, 9th ed.) was written.</p>

<p>The chief character which distinguishes the Batrachians
from the reptiles, leaving aside the metamorphoses, lies in the
arrangement of the bones of the palate, where a large parasphenoid
extends forwards as far or nearly as far as the vomers
and widely separates the pterygoids. The bones which bear the
two occipital condyles have given rise to much discussion, and
the definition given by Huxley in the previous edition&mdash;&ldquo;two
occipital condyles, the basi-occipital region of the skull either
very incompletely or not at all ossified&rdquo;&mdash;requires revision.
Some authors have held that the bone on which the occipital
condyles have been found most developed in some labyrinthodonts
(<b>2</b>) represents a large basi-occipital bearing two knobs
for the articulation with the first vertebra, whilst the skull
of the batrachians of the present day has lost the basi-occipital,
and the condyles are furnished by the exoccipitals. On the
other hand, some reptiles have the occipital condyle divided into
two and produced either by the basi-occipital or by the exoccipitals.
But the recent find of a well preserved skull of a
labyrinthodont (<i>Capitosaurus stantonensis</i>) from the Trias of
Staffordshire has enabled A.S. Woodward (<b>3</b>) to show that, in
that form at any rate, the condyles are really exoccipital, although
they are separated by a narrow basi-occipital. It is therefore
very probable that the authors quoted in (<b>2</b>) were mistaken in
their identification of the elements at the base of the foramen
magnum. The fact remains, however, that some if not all of
the stegocephalous batrachians have an ossified basi-occipital.</p>

<p>As a result of his researches on the anomodont reptiles and
the Stegocephalia (<b>4</b>), as the extinct order that includes the
well known labyrinthodonts is now called, we have had the
proposal by H.G. Seeley (<b>5</b>) to place the latter with the reptiles
instead of with the batrachians, and H. Gadow, in his most
recent classification (<b>6</b>), places some of them among the reptiles,
others being left with the batrachians; whilst H. Credner,
basing his views on the discovery by him of various annectent
forms between the Stegocephalia and the Rhynchocephalian
reptiles, has proposed a class, <i>Eotetrapoda</i>, to include these forms,
ancestors of the batrachians proper on the one hand, of the
reptiles proper on the other. Yet, that the Stegocephalia,
notwithstanding their great affinity to the reptiles, ought to
be included in the batrachians as commonly understood, seems
sufficiently obvious from the mere fact of their passing through
a branchiate condition, <i>i.e.</i> undergoing metamorphosis (<b>7</b>).
The outcome of our present knowledge points to the Stegocephalia,
probably themselves derived from the Crossopterygian
fishes (<b>8</b>), having yielded on the one hand the true batrachians
(retrogressive series), with which they are to a certain extent
connected through the <i>Caudata</i> and the <i>Apoda</i>, on the other
hand the reptiles (progressive series), through the Rhynchocephalians
and the Anomodonts, the latter being believed, on
very suggestive evidence, to lead to the mammals (<b>9</b>).</p>

<p>The division of the class Amphibia or Batrachia into four
orders, as carried out by Huxley, is maintained, with, however,
a change of names: <i>Stegocephalia</i>, for the assemblage of minor
groups that cluster round
the <i>Labyrinthodonta</i> of R.
Owen, which name is restricted
to the forms for
which it was originally intended;
<i>Peromela</i>, <i>Urodela</i>,
<i>Anura</i>, are changed to
<i>Apoda</i>, <i>Caudata</i>, <i>Ecaudata</i>,
for the reason that (unless
obviously misleading, which
is not the case in the
present instance) the first
proposed name should supersede
all others for higher
groups as well as for genera
and species, and the latter
set have the benefit of the
law of priority. In the
first subdivision of the batrachians
into two families by
C. Duméril in 1806 (<i>Zool.
Anal</i>. pp. 90-94) these are
termed &ldquo;Anoures&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Urodeles&rdquo; in French,
<i>Ecaudati</i> and <i>Caudati</i> in
Latin. When Duméril&rsquo;s
pupil, M. Oppel, in 1811
(<i>Ordn. Rept</i>. p. 72), added
the Caecilians, he named
the three groups <i>Apoda</i>,
<i>Ecaudata</i> and <i>Caudata</i>. The
Latin form being the only
one entitled to recognition
in zoological nomenclature, it follows that the last-mentioned
names should be adopted for the three orders into which recent
batrachians are divided.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>I. <span class="sc">Stegocephalia</span> (<b>10</b>).&mdash;Tailed, lacertiform or serpentiform batrachians,
with the temporal region of the skull roofed over by
postorbital, squamosal, and supratemporal plates similar to the
same bones in Crossopterygian fishes, and likewise with paired
dermal bones (occipitals and post-temporals) behind the parietals
and supratemporals. A parietal foramen; scales or bony scutes
frequently present, especially on the ventral region, which is further
protected by three large bony plates&mdash;interclavicle and clavicles,
the latter in addition to cleithra.</p>

<p>Extinct, ranging from the Upper Devonian to the Trias. Our
knowledge of Devonian forms is still extremely meagre, the only
certain proof of the existence of pentadactyle vertebrates at that
period resting on the footprints discovered in Pennsylvania and
described by O.C. Marsh (<b>11</b>) as <i>Tinopus antiquus</i>. Sundry remains
from Belgium, as to the identification of which doubts are still
entertained, have been regarded by M. Lohest (<b>12</b>) as evidence of
these batrachians in the Devonian. Over 200 species are now distinguished,
from the Carboniferous of Europe and North America,
the Permian of Spitsbergen, Europe, North America and South
Africa, and the Trias of Europe, America, South Africa, India and
Australia. The forms of batrachians with which we are acquainted
show the vertebral column to have been evolved in the course of
time from a notochordal condition with segmented centra similar
to that of early bony ganoid fishes (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Caturus</i>, <i>Eurycormus</i>), to
biconcave centra, and finally to the socket-and-ball condition that
prevails at the present day. However, owing to the evolution of the
vertebral column in various directions, and to the inconstant state
of things in certain annectent groups, it is not possible, it seems, to
apply the vertebral characters to taxonomy with that rigidity which
E.D. Cope and some other recent authors have attempted to enforce.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page523" id="page523"></a>523</span>
This is particularly evident in the case of the Stegocephalians; and
recent batrachians, tailed and tailless, show the mode of articulation
of the vertebrae, whether amphicoelous, opisthocoelous or procoelous,
to be of but secondary systematic importance in dealing with these
lowly vertebrates. The following division of the Stegocephalians
into five sub-orders is therefore open to serious criticism; but it
seems on the whole the most natural to adopt in the light of our
present knowledge.</p>

<p><b>A. Rhachitomi</b>, (figs. 1, 2), in which the spinal cord rests
on the notochord, which persists uninterrupted and is surrounded by
three bony elements in addition to the neural arch: a so-called
pleurocentrum on each side, which appears to represent the centrum
proper of reptiles and mammals, and an intercentrum or hypocentrum
below, which may extend to the neural arch, and probably
answers to the hypapophysis, as it is produced into chevrons in the
caudal region. Mostly large forms, of Carboniferous and Permian
age, with a more or less complex infolding of the walls of the teeth.
Families: <span class="sc">Archegosauridae, Eryopidae, Trimerorhachidae,
Dissorhophidae.</span> The last is remarkable for an extraordinary
endo- and exo-skeletal carapace, <i>Dissorhophus</i> being described by
Cope (<b>13</b>) as a &ldquo;batrachian armadillo.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>B. Embolomeri</b>, with the centra and intercentra equally
developed disks, of which there are thus two to each neural arch;
these disks perforated in the middle for the passage of the notochord.
This type may be directly derived from the preceding, with which
it appears to be connected by the genus <i>Diplospondylus</i>.
Fam.: <span class="sc">Cricotidae</span>, Permian.</p>

<tr><td class="caption80">(Outline after Jaekel.)</td></tr></table>

<p><b>C. Labyrinthodonta</b>, with simple biconcave vertebral disks, very
slightly pierced by a remnant of the notochord and supporting the
loosely articulated neural arch. This condition is derived from
that of the <i>Rhachitomi</i>, as shown by the structure of the
vertebral column in young specimens. Mostly large forms from the
Trias (a few Permian), with true labyrinthic dentition. Families:
<span class="sc">Labyrinthodontidae, Anthracosauridae, Dendrerpetidae, Nyraniidae</span>.</p>

<p><b>D. Microsauria</b>, nearest the reptiles, with persistent notochord
completely surrounded by constricted cylinders on which the neural
arch rests. Teeth hollow, with simple or only slightly folded walls.
Mostly of small size and abundant in the Carboniferous and Lower
Permian. Families: <span class="sc">Urocordylidae, Limnerpetidae, Hylonomidae</span> (fig. 3),
<span class="sc">Microbrachidae, Dolichosomatidae</span>, the latter serpentiform, apodal.</p>

<p><b>E. Branchiosauria</b>, nearest to the true batrachians; with
persistent non-constricted notochord, surrounded by barrel-shaped,
bony cylinders formed by the neural arch above and a pair of
intercentra below, both these elements taking an equal share in the
formation of a transverse process on each side for the support of the
rib. This plan of structure, apparently evolved out of the rhachitomous
type by suppression of the pleurocentra and the downward extension
of the neural arch, leads to that characteristic of frogs in which, as
development shows, the vertebra is formed wholly or for the greater
part by the neural arch (<b>14</b>). Small forms from the Upper Carboniferous
and Permian formations. A single family: <span class="sc">Branchiosauridae</span>.</p>

<p>II. <span class="sc">Apoda</span> (<b>15</b>).&mdash;No limbs. Tail vestigial or absent. Frontal
bones distinct from parietals; palatines fused with maxillaries.
Male with an intromittent copulatory organ. Degraded, worm-like
batrachians of still obscure affinities, inhabiting tropical Africa,
south-eastern Asia and tropical America. Thirty-three species are
known. No fossils have yet been discovered. It has been attempted
of late to do away with this order altogether and to make the
Caecilians merely a family of the Urodeles. This view has originated
out of the very remarkable superficial resemblance between the
<i>Ichthyophis</i>-larva and the <i>Amphiuma</i>. Cope (<b>16</b>) regarded
the Apoda as the extremes of a line of degeneration from the Salamanders,
with <i>Amphiuma</i> as one of the annectent forms. In the opinion of
P. and F. Sarasin (<b>17</b>), whose great work on the development of
<i>Ichthyophis</i> is one of the most important recent contributions
to our knowledge of the batrachians, <i>Amphiuma</i> is a sort of
neotenic Caecilian, a larval form become sexually mature while retaining
the branchial respiration.  If the absence of limbs and the reduction of
the tail were the only characteristic of the group, there would be,
of course, no objection to unite the Caecilians with the Urodeles; but,
to say nothing of the scales, present in many genera of Apodals and
absent in all Caudates, which have been shown by H. Credner to be
identical in structure with those of Stegocephalians, the Caecilian skull
presents features which are not shared by any of the tailed batrachians.
G.M. Winslow (<b>18</b>), who has made a study of the
chondrocranium of <i>Ichthyophis</i>, concludes that its condition could
not have been derived from a Urodele form, but points to some more
primitive ancestor. That this ancestor was nearly related to, if not
one of, the Stegocephalians, future discovery will in all probability show.</p>

<p>III. <span class="sc">Caudata</span> (<b>19</b>).&mdash;Tailed batrachians, with the frontals distinct
from the parietals and the palatines from the maxillary. Some of
the forms breathe by gills throughout their existence, and were
formerly regarded as establishing a passage from the fishes to the
air-breathing batrachians. They are now considered as arrested
larvae descended from the latter. One of the most startling discoveries
of the decade 1890-1900 was the fact that a number of forms
are devoid of both gills and lungs, and breathe merely by the skin
and the buccal mucose membrane (<b>20</b>). Three blind cave-forms are
known: one terrestrial&mdash;<i>Typhlotriton</i>, from North America, and
two perennibranchiate&mdash;<i>Proteus</i> in Europe and <i>Typhlomolge</i>
in North America.</p>

<p>This order contains about 150 species, referred to five families:
<span class="sc">Hylaeobatrachidae, Salamandridae, Amphiumidae, Proteidae, Sirenidae</span>.</p>

<p>Fossil remains are few in the Upper Eocene and Miocene of Europe
and the Upper Cretaceous of North America. The oldest Urodele
known is <i>Hylaeobatrachus</i> Dollo (<b>21</b>) from the Lower Wealden of
Belgium. At present this order is confined to the northern hemisphere,
with the exception of two <i>Spelerpes</i> from the Andes of Ecuador
and Peru, and a <i>Plethodon</i> from Argentina.</p>

<p><span class="sc">IV. Ecaudata</span> (<b>22</b>).&mdash;Frogs and toads. Four limbs and no tail.
Radius confluent with ulna, and tibia with fibula; tarsus (astragalus
and calcaneum) elongate, forming an additional segment in the hind
limb. Caudal vertebrae fused into a urostyle or coccyx. Frontal
bones confluent with parietals.</p>

<p>This order embraces about 1300 species, of which some 40 are
fossil, divided into two sub-orders and sixteen families:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>A. Aglossa</b>,&mdash;Eustachian tubes united into a single ostium
pharyngeum; no tongue. <span class="sc">Dactylethridae, Pipidae</span>.</p>

<p><b>B. Phaneroglossa</b>,&mdash;Eustachian tubes separated; tongue present.
<span class="sc">Discoglossidae, Pelobatidae, Hemiphractidae, Amphignathodontidae,
Hylidae, Bufonidae, Dendrophryniscidae, Cystignathidae, Dyscophidae,
Genyophrynidae, Engystomatidae, Ceratobatrachidae, Ranidae,
Dendrobatidae</span>.</p>

<p>The Phaneroglossa are divided into two groups; <i>Arcifera</i> and
<i>Firmisternia</i>, representing two stages of evolution. The family
characters are mainly derived from the dilatation or non-dilatation of
the sacral diapophyses, and the presence of teeth in one or both jaws,
or their absence. The <i>Discoglossidae</i> are noteworthy for the presence
of short ribs to some of the vertebrae, and in some other points also
they approach the tailed batrachians; they may be safely regarded
as, on the whole, the most generalized of known Ecaudata. Distinct
ribs are present at an early age in the Aglossa, as discovered by
W.G. Ridewood (<b>23</b>). The recent addition of a third genus of Aglossa,
<i>Hymenochirus</i> (<b>24</b>) from tropical Africa, combining characters
of <i>Pipa</i> and <i>Xenopus</i>, has removed every doubt as to the real
affinity which connects these genera. <i>Hymenochirus</i> is further
remarkable for the presence of only six distinct pieces in the vertebral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>524</span>
column, which is thus the most abbreviated among all the
vertebrata.</p>

<p>Frogs and toads occur wherever insect food is procurable, and
their distribution is a world-wide one, with the exception of many
islands. Thus New Caledonia, which has a rich and quite special
lizard-fauna, has no batrachians of its own, although the Australian
<i>Hyla aurea</i> has been introduced with success. New Zealand possesses
only one species (<i>Liopelma hochstetteri</i>), which appears to be rare
and restricted to the North Island. The forest regions of southern
Asia, Africa and South America are particularly rich in species.</p>

<p>According to our present knowledge, the Ecaudata can be traced
about as far back in time as the Caudata. An unmistakable
batrachian of this order, referred by its describer to <i>Palaeobatrachus</i>,
a determination which is only provisional, has been discovered in
the Kimmeridgian of the Sierra del Montsech, Catalonia (<b>25</b>), in
a therefore somewhat older formation than the Wealden Caudata
<i>Hylaeobatrachus</i>.</p>

<p>Apart from a few unsatisfactory remains from the Eocene of
Wyoming, fossil tailless batrachians are otherwise only known from
the Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene of Europe and India. These
forms differ very little from those that live at the present day in the
same part of the world, and some of the genera (<i>Discoglossus, Bufo,
Oxyglossus, Rana</i>) are even identical. <i>Palaeobatrachus</i> (<b>26</b>), of which
a number of species represented by skeletons of the perfect form
and of the tadpole have been described from Miocene beds in Germany,
Bohemia and France, seems to be referable to the <i>Pelobatidae</i>;
this genus has been considered as possibly one of the Aglossa,
but the absence of ribs in the larvae speaks against such an
association.</p>

<p>Numerous additions have been made to our knowledge of the
development and nursing habits, which are extremely varied, some
forms dispensing with or hurrying through the metamorphoses
and hopping out of the egg in the perfect condition (<b>27</b>).</p>

<p><i>Skeleton</i>.&mdash;In the earliest forms of this order, the Stegocephalia,
we meet with considerable variety in the constitution of the vertebrae,
and these modifications have been used for their classification.
All agree, however, in having each vertebra formed of at least two
pieces, the suture between which persists throughout life. In this
they differ from the three orders which have living representatives.
Even the inferior arches or chevrons of the tail of salamanders are
continuously ossified with the centra. As a matter of fact, these
vertebrae have no centra proper, that part which should correspond
with the centrum being formed, as a study of the development has
shown (H. Gadow, <b>14</b>), by the meeting and subsequent complete
co-ossification of the two chief dorsal and ventral pairs of elements
(tail-vertebrae of Caudata), or entirely by the pair of dorsal elements.
In the Ecaudata, the vertebrae of the trunk are formed on two
different plans. In some the notochord remains for a long time
exposed along the ventral surface, and, owing to the absence of
cartilaginous formation around it, disappears without ever becoming
invested otherwise than by a thin elastic membrane; it can be
easily stripped off below the vertebrae in larval specimens on the
point of metamorphosing. This has been termed the <i>epichordal</i>
type. In others, which represent the <i>perichordal</i> type, the greater
share of the formation of the whole vertebra falls to the (paired)
dorsal cartilage, but there is in addition a narrow ventral or hypochordal
cartilage which fuses with the dorsal or becomes connected
with it by calcified tissue; the notochord is thus completely surrounded
by a thick sheath in tadpoles with imperfectly developed
limbs. This mode of formation of both the arch and the greater
part or whole of the so-called centrum from the same cartilage
explains why there is never a neuro-central suture in these batrachians.</p>

<p class="pt2">During segmentation of the dorsal cartilages mentioned above,
which send out the transverse processes of diapophyses, there appears
between each two centra an intervertebral cartilage, out of which the
articulating condyle of the centrum is formed, and becomes attached
either to the vertebra anterior (precoelous type) or posterior (opisthocoelous type) to it, if not remaining as an independent, intervertebral,
ossified sphere, as we sometimes find in specimens of
<i>Pelobatidae</i>.</p>

<p>In the Caudata and Apoda, cartilage often persists between
the vertebrae; this cartilage may become imperfectly separated
into a cup-and-ball portion, the cup belonging to the posterior end
of the vertebra. In such cases the distinction between amphicoelous
and opisthocoelous vertebrae rests merely on a question of ossification,
and has occasionally given rise to misunderstandings in the
use of these terms.</p>

<p class="pt2">All living batrachians, and some of the Stegocephalia, have transverse
processes on the vertebrae that succeed the atlas (fig. 4), some
of which, in the Caudata,
are divided into
a dorsal and a ventral
portion. Ribs are
present in the lower
Ecaudata (<i>Discoglossidae</i>
and larval
Aglossa), but they are
never connected with a
sternum. It is in fact
doubtful whether the
so-called sternum of
batrachians, in most
cases a mere plate of
cartilage, has been correctly
identified as such.
When limbs are present,
one vertebra, rarely two
(fig. 5) or three, are
distinguished as sacral,
giving attachment to
the ilia. In the Ecaudata,
the form of the
transverse processes of
the sacral vertebra
varies very considerably,
and has afforded
important characters to
the systematist. In
accordance with the
saltatorial habits of the
members of this order,
the vertebrae, which
number from 40 to 60
in the Caudata, to upwards
of 200 in the
Apoda, have become
reduced to 10 as the
normal number, viz.,
eight praecaudal, one sacral and an elongate coccyx or urostyle,
formed by coalescence of at least two vertebrae. In some genera
this coccyx is fused with the ninth vertebra, and contributes to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page525" id="page525"></a>525</span>
sacrum, whilst in a few others the number of segments is still
further reduced by the co-ossification of one or two vertebrae
preceding that corresponding to the normal sacral and by the fusion
of the two first vertebrae, the extreme of reduction being found in
the genus <i>Hymenochirus</i>, the vertebral column of which is figured
here (fig 6.)</p>

<p class="pt2">As stated above in the definition of the order, the Stegocephalia
have retained most of the cranial bones which are to be found in the
Crossopterygian fishes, and it is worthy of note that the bones termed
post-temporals may give attachment to a further bone so prolonged
backwards as to suggest the probability of the skull being connected
with the shoulder-girdle, as in most teleostome fishes. This supposition
is supported by a specimen from the Lower Permian of
Autun, determined as <i>Actinodon frossardi</i>, acquired in 1902 by the
British Museum, which shows a bone, similar to the so-called &ldquo;epiotic
cornu&rdquo; of the microsaurians, <i>Ceraterpeton</i> and <i>Scincosaurus</i>, to have
the relations of the supra-cleithrum of fishes, thus confirming a
suggestion made by C.W. Andrews (<b>28</b>). As in fishes also, the
sensory canal system must have been highly developed on the skulls
of many labyrinthodonts, and the impressions left by these canals
have been utilized by morphologists for homologizing the various
elements of the cranial roof with those of Crossopterygians. The
pineal foramen, in the parietal bones, is as constantly present as it
is absent in the other orders. Although not strictly forming part
of the skull, allusion should be made here to the ring of sclerotic
plates which has been found in many of the Stegocephalia, and
which is only found elsewhere in a few Crossopterygian fishes as well
as in many reptiles and birds.</p>

<p>In the orders which are still represented at the present day, the
bones of the skull are reduced in number and the &ldquo;primordial
skull,&rdquo; or chondrocranium (fig. 7), remains to a greater or less extent
unossified, even in the adult. Huxley&rsquo;s figures of the skull of a
caccilian (<i>Ichthyophis glutinosus</i>), fig. 8, of a perennibranchiate
urodele (<i>Necturus maculosus = Menobranchus lateralis</i>), fig. 9, and of
a frog (<i>Rana esculenta</i>), fig. 10, are here given for comparison.</p>

<p>The skull, in the <i>Apoda</i>, is remarkably solid and compact, and it
possesses a postorbital or postfrontal bone (marked 1 in the figure)
which does not exist in any of the other living batrachians. The
squamosal bone is large and either in contact with the frontals and
parietals or separated from them by a vacuity; the orbit is sometimes
roofed over by bone. The presence, in some genera, of a second
row of mandibular teeth seems to indicate the former existence of
a splenial element, such as exists in <i>Siren</i> among the Caudata and
apparently in the labyrinthodonts.</p>

<p>In the Caudata, the frontals remain likewise distinct from the
parietals, whilst in the Ecaudata the two elements are fused into
one, and in a few forms (Aglossa, some <i>Pelobalidae</i>) the paired condition
of these bones has disappeared in the adult. Prefrontal bones
are present in the <i>Salamandridae</i> and <i>Amphiumidae</i>, but absent (or
fused with the nasals) in the other Caudata and in the Ecaudata.
In most of the former the palatines fuse with the vomers, whilst they
remain distinct, unless entirely lost, in the latter. The vomer is single,
or absent, in the Aglossa. In the lower jaw of most of the Ecaudata
the symphysial cartilages ossify separately from the dentary bones,
forming the so-called mento-meckelian bones; but these symphysial
bones, so distinct in the frog, are less so in the <i>Hylidae</i> and <i>Bufonidae</i>,
almost indistinguishable in the <i>Pelobatidae</i> and <i>Discoglossidae</i>, whilst
in the Aglossa they do not exist any more than in the other orders
of batrachians.</p>

<p>No batrachian is known to possess an ossified azygous supra-occipital.</p>

<p class="pt2">Although there are four branchial arches in all the larval forms
of the three orders, and throughout life in the <i>Sirenidae</i>, the perennibranchiate
<i>Proteidae</i> have only three (see fig. 11). In the adult
Apoda these arches and the hyoid fuse into three transverse, curved
or angular bones (see fig. 13), the two posterior disconnected from
the hyoid. In the Ecaudata, as shown by F. Gaupp (<b>29</b>) and by
W.G. Ridewood (<b>30</b>), the whole hyobranchial apparatus forms a
cartilaginous continuum, and during metamorphosis the branchialia
disappear without a trace. The hyoid of the adult frog (fig. 12)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page526" id="page526"></a>526</span>
consists of a plate of cartilage with two slender cornua, three processes
on each side, and two long bony rods behind, termed the thyro-hyals, which
embrace the larynx.  In the Aglossa, which are remarkable for the
large size and complexity of the larynx, the thyro-hyal bones
are incorporated into the laryngeal apparatus, whilst the recently
discovered <i>Hymenochirus</i> is further remarkable for the large
size and ossification of the hyoidean cornua (ceratohyals), a feature
which, though not uncommon among the salamanders, is unique
among the Ecaudata (<b>31</b>).</p>

<p class="pt2">The pectoral girdle of the Stegocephalia is, of course, only known
from the ossified elements, the identification of which has given
rise to some diversity of opinion. But C. Gegenbaur&rsquo;s (<b>32</b>) interpretation
may be regarded as final. He has shown that, as in the Crossopterygian
and Chondrostean ganoid fishes, there are two clavicular elements
on each side; the lower corresponds to the clavicle of reptiles
and higher vertebrates, whilst the upper corresponds to
the clavicle of teleostean fishes, and has been named by him
&ldquo;cleithrum.&rdquo; As stated above, there is strong evidence in favour of
the view that some forms at least possessed in addition a
&ldquo;supracleithrum,&rdquo; corresponding to the supra-clavicle of bony
fishes. The element often termed &ldquo;coracoid&rdquo; in these fossils
would be the scapula. The clavicles rest on a large discoidal,
rhomboidal, or T-shaped median bone, which clearly corresponds to
the interclavicle of reptiles.</p>

<p>The pectoral girdle of the living types of
batrachians is distinguishable into a
scapular, a coracoidal, and a praecoracoidal
region. In most of the Caudata the scapular
region alone ossifies, but in the Ecaudata
the coracoid is bony and a clavicle is frequently
developed over the praecoracoid cartilage.
In these batrachians the pectoral
arch falls into two distinct types&mdash;the
<i>arciferous</i>, in which the
precoracoid (+ clavicle) and coracoid are widely separated from
each other distally and connected by an arched cartilage (the
epicoracoid), the right usually overlapping the left; and the
<i>firmisternal</i>, in which both precoracoid and coracoid nearly abut on the
median line, and are only narrowly separated by the more or less
fused epicoracoids. The former type is exemplified by the toads
and the lower Ecaudata, whilst the latter is characteristic of the
true frogs (<i>Ranidae</i>), although when quite young these batrachians
present a condition similar to that which persists throughout life
in their lower relatives. A cartilage in the median line in front of
the precoracoids, sometimes supported by a bony style,
is the so-called Omosternum; a large one behind the cora-coids,
also sometimes provided with a bony style, has
been called the sternum. But these names will probably
have to be changed when the homologies of
these parts are better understood.</p>

<p>The pelvic arch of some of the Stegocephalia contained
a well ossified pubic element, whilst in all other
batrachians only the ilium, or the ilium and the ischium
are ossified. In the Ecaudata the ilium is greatly
elongated and the pubis and ischium are flattened, discoidal,
and closely applied to their fellows by their inner
surfaces; the pelvic girdle looks like a pair of tongs.</p>

<p>The long bones of the limbs consist of an axis of
cartilage; the extremities of the cartilages frequently
undergo calcification and
are thus converted into epiphyses. In the Ecaudata the radius and
ulna coalesce into one bone. The carpus, which remains cartilaginous
in many of the Stegocephalia and Caudata, contains six to eight
elements when the manus is fully developed, whilst the number is
reduced in those forms which have only two or three digits. Except
in some of the Stegocephalia, there are only four functional digits
in the manus, but the Ecaudata have a more or less distinct rudiment
of pollex; in the Caudata it seems to be the outer digit which
has been suppressed, as atavistic reappearance of a fifth digit takes
place on the outer side of the manus, as it does on the pes in those
forms in which the toes are reduced to four. The usual number of
phalanges is 2, 2, 3, 2 in the Stegocephalia and Caudata, 2, 2, 3, 3 in the
Ecaudata. In the foot the digits usually number five, and the phalanges
2, 2, 3, 3, 2 in the Caudata, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3 in the Stegocephalia and
Ecaudata. There are occasionally intercalary ossifications between
the two distal phalanges (<b>33</b>). There are usually nine tarsal elements
in the Caudata; this number is reduced in the Ecaudata, in which
the two bones of the proximal row (sometimes coalesced) are much
elongated and form an additional segment to the greatly lengthened
hind-limb, a sort of <i>crus secundarium</i>. In the Ecaudata also, the
tibia and fibula coalesce into one bone, and two or three small bones
on the inner side of the tarsus form what has been regarded as a
rudimentary digit or &ldquo;prehallux.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Integument.</i>&mdash;In all recent batrachians, the skin is naked, or if
small scales are present, as in many of the
Apoda, they are concealed in the skin. The
extinct Stegocephalia, on the other hand,
were mostly protected, on the ventral surface
at least, by an armour of overlapping
round, oval, or rhomboidal scales, often
very similar to those of Crossopterygian or
ganoid fishes, and likewise disposed in transverse
oblique lines converging forwards on
the middle line of the belly. Sometimes
these scales assumed the importance of
scutes and formed a carapace, as in the
&ldquo;batrachian armadillo&rdquo; discovered by E.D.
Cope. A few frogs have the skin of the
back studded with stellate bony deposits
(<i>Phyllomedusa, Nototrema</i>), whilst two genera
are remarkable for possessing a bony dorsal
shield, free from the vertebrae (<i>Ceratorphrys</i>)
or ankylosed to them (<i>Brachycephalus</i>).
None of the Stegocephalia appears to have
been provided with claws, but some living
batrachians (<i>Onychodactylus, Xenopus, Hymenochirus</i>) have the tips
of some or all of the digits protected by a claw-like horny sheath.</p>

<p>The integument of tailed and tailless batrachians is remarkable
for the great abundance of follicular glands, of which there may
be two kinds, each having a special secretion, which is always more
or less acrid and irritating, and affords a means of defence against
the attacks of many carnivorous animals. A great deal has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page527" id="page527"></a>527</span>
published on the poisonous secretion of batrachians (<b>34</b>), which is utilized by the Indians of South America for poisoning their arrows. Some of the poison-secreting glands attain a greater complication of structure and are remarkable for their large size, such as the
so-called &ldquo;parotoid&rdquo; glands on the back of the
head in toads and salamanders.</p>

<p>In all larval forms, in the Caudata, and in
a few of the Ecaudata (<i>Xenopus</i>, for instance),
the epidermis becomes modified in relation
with the termination of sensory nerves, and
gives rise to organs of the same nature as
those of the lateral line of fishes. In addition
to diffuse pigment (mostly in the epidermis),
the skin contains granular pigment stored up
in cells, the chromatophores, restricted to the
cutis, which are highly mobile and send out
branches which, by contraction and expansion,
may rapidly alter the coloration, most
batrachians being in this respect quite comparable
to the famous chameleons. Besides
white (guanine) cells, the pigment includes
black, brown, yellow and red. The green
and blue, so frequent in frogs and newts,
are merely subjective colours, due to interference.
On the mechanism of the change of
colour, cf. W. Biedermann (<b>35</b>).</p>

<p>One of the interesting recent discoveries is
that of the &ldquo;hairy&rdquo; frog (<i>Trichobatrachus</i>), in
which the sides of the body and limbs are
covered with long villosities, the function of
which is still unknown (<b>36</b>).</p>

<p>The nuptial horny asperities with which
the males of many batrachians are provided,
for the purpose of clinging to the females, will
be noticed below, under the heading <i>Pairing
and Oviposition</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dentition</i>.&mdash;In the Microsauria and Branchiosauria
among the Stegocephalia, as in the
other orders, the hollow, conical or slightly
curved teeth exhibit simple or only slightly
folded walls. But in the Labyrinthodonta,
grooves are more or less marked along the
teeth and give rise to folds of the wall which,
extending inwards and ramifying, produce the
complicated structure, exhibited by transverse
sections, whence these batrachians derive
their name; a somewhat similar complexity
of structure is known in some holoptychian
(dendrodont) Crossopterygian fishes.
In the remarkable salamander <i>Autodax</i>, the
teeth in the jaws are compressed, sharp-edged,
lancet shaped. The teeth are not implanted
in sockets, but become ankylosed with the
bones that bear them, and are replaced by
others developed at their bases. Teeth are
present in the jaws of all known Stegocephalia
and Apoda and of nearly all Caudata, <i>Siren</i>
alone presenting plates of horn upon the
gingival surfaces of the premaxillae and of
the dentary elements of the mandible. But
they are nearly always absent in the lower
jaw of the Ecaudata (exceptions in <i>Hemiphractus,
Amphignathodon, Amphodus, Ceratobatrachus</i>,
the male of <i>Dimorphognathus</i>), many
of which (toads, for instance) are entirely
edentulous.</p>

<p>There is great variety in the distribution
of the teeth on the palate. They may occur
simultaneously on the vomers, the palatines,
the pterygoids and the parasphenoid in
some of the Stegocephalia (<i>Dawsonia, Seeleya,
Acanthostoma</i>), on the vomers, palatines and
parasphenoid in many salamandrids (<i>Plethodontinae</i>
and <i>Desmognathinae</i>), on the vomers,
pterygoids and parasphenoid (some <i>Pelobates</i>),
on the vomers and parasphenoid (<i>Triprion,
Amphodus</i>), whilst in the majority or other
batrachians they are confined to the vomers
and palatines or to the vomers alone (<b>37</b>).</p>

<p>As regards the alimentary organs, it will
suffice to state, in this very brief sketch, that
all batrachians being carnivorous in their
perfect condition, the intestine is never very
long and its convolutions are few and simple.
But the larvae of the Ecaudata are mainly
herbivorous and the digestive tract is accordingly
extremely elongate and coiled up like the spring
of a watch. The gullet is short, except in the Apoda.
The tongue is rudimentary in the perennibranchiatea Caudata,
well developed, and often protrusile, in the <i>Salamandridae</i>
and most of the Ecaudata, totally absent in the Aglossa.</p>

<p>The organs of circulation cannot be dealt with here; the most important
addition made to our knowledge in recent years being found in the
contributions of F. Hochstetter (<b>38</b>) and of G.B. Howes (<b>39</b>), dealing
with the azygous (posterior) cardinal veins in salamanders and some of
the Ecaudata. The heart is situated quite forward, in the gular or
pectoral region, even in those tailed batrachians which have a
serpentiform body, whilst in the Apoda (fig. 13) it is moved back to a
distance which is comparable to that it occupies in most of the snakes.</p>

<p><i>The Respiratory Organs</i>.&mdash;The larynx, which is rudimentary in most of
the Caudata and in the Apoda, is highly developed in the Ecaudata, and
becomes the instrument of the powerful voice with which many of the
frogs and toads are provided. The lungs are long simple tubes in some of
the perennibranchiate Caudata; they generally shorten or become cellular
in the salamandrids, and attain their highest development in the
Ecaudata, especially in such forms as the burrowing <i>Pelobates</i>.
Although the lungs are present in such forms as preserve the gills
throughout life, it is highly remarkable that quite a number of
abranchiate salamanders, belonging mostly to the subfamilies
<i>Desmognathinae</i> and <i>Plethodontinae</i>, are devoid of lungs and breathe
entirely by the skin and by the bucco-pharyngeal mucose membrane (<b>20</b>).
Some of the <i>Salamandrinae</i> show the intermediate conditions which have
led to the suppression of the trachea and lungs. In the Apoda, as in
many serpentiform reptiles, one of the lungs, either the right or the
left, is much less developed than the other, often very short.</p>

<p><i>Urino-genital Organs</i>.&mdash;The genital glands, ovaries and testes, are
attached to the dorsal wall of the body-cavity, in the immediate
vicinity of the kidneys, with which the male glands are intimately
connected. The oviducts are long, usually more or less convoluted tubes
which open posteriorly into the cloaca, while their anterior aperture is
situated far forward, sometimes close to the root of the lung; their
walls secrete a gelatinous substance which invests the ova as they
descend. In most male batrachians the testes are drained by transverse
canals which open into a longitudinal duct, which also receives the
canals of the kidneys, so that this common duct conveys both sperma and
urine. In some of the discogloesid frogs, however, the seminal duct is
quite independent of the kidney, which has its own canal, or true
ureter. Many of the Ecaudata have remnants of oviducts, or Müllerian
ducts, most developed in <i>Bufo</i>, which genus is also remarkable as
possessing a problematic organ, Bidder&rsquo;s organ, situated between the
testis and the adipose or fat-bodies that surmount it. This has been
regarded by some anatomists as a rudimentary ovary. Female salamandrids
are provided with a <i>receptaculum seminis</i>. Copulatory organs are
absent, except in the Apoda, in which a portion of the cloaca can be
everted and acts as a penis. The urinary bladder is always large.</p>

<p>The spermatozoa have received a great share of attention, on the part
not only of anatomists and physiologists, but even of systematic workers
(<b>40</b>). This is due to the great amount of difference in structure and
size between these elements in the various genera, and also to the fact
that otherwise closely allied species may differ very considerably in
this respect. The failure to obtain hybrids between certain species of
<i>Rana</i> has been attributed principally to these differences. The
spermatozoa of <i>Discoglossus</i> are remarkable for their great size,
measuring three millimetres in length.</p>

<p><i>Pairing and Oviposition</i>&mdash;Batrachians may be divided into four
categories under this head:&mdash;(1) no amplexation; (2) amplexation without
internal fecundation; (3) amplexation with internal fecundation; (4)
copulation proper. The first category embraces many aquatic newts, the
second nearly all the Ecaudata, the third the rest of the Caudata, and
the fourth the Apoda.</p>

<p>In the typical newts (<i>Molge</i>) of Europe, the males are adorned during
the breeding season with bright colours and crests or other ornamental
dermal appendages, and, resorting to the water, they engage in a lengthy
courtship accompanied by lively evolutions around the females, near
which they deposit their spermatozoa in bundles on a gelatinous mass,
the spermatophore, probably secreted by the cloacal gland. This
arrangement facilitates the internal fecundation of the female without
copulation, the female absorbs the spermatozoa by squeezing them out of
the spermatophore between the cloacal lips. Other newts, and many
salamanders, whether terrestrial or aquatic, pair, the male embracing
the female about the fore limbs or in the pelvic region, and the males
of such forms are invariably devoid of ornamental secondary sexual
characters; but in spite of this amplexation the same mode of
fecundation by means of a spermatophore is resorted to, although it may
happen that the contents of the spermatophore are absorbed direct from
the cloaca of the male. The spermatozoa thus reach the eggs in the
oviducts, where they may develop entirely, some of the salamanders being
viviparous.</p>

<p>In all the tailless batrachians (with the exception of a single known
viviparous toad), the male clings to the female round the breast, at the
arm-pits, or round the waist, and awaits, often for hours or days, the
deposition of the ova, which are immediately fecundated by several
seminal emissions.</p>

<p>The fourth category is represented by the Apoda or Caecilians
in which, as we have stated above, the male is provided with an
intromittent organ. Some of these batrachians are viviparous.</p>

<p>In those species in which the embrace is of long duration the limbs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page528" id="page528"></a>528</span>
of the male, usually the fore limbs (pleurodele newt, Ecaudata),
rarely the hind limbs (a few American and European newts), according
to the mode of amplexation, acquire a greater development, and
are often armed with temporary horny excrescences which drop off
after the pairing season. These asperities usually form brush-like
patches on the inner side of one or more of the digits, but may extend
over the inner surface of the limbs and on the breast and chin;
the use of them on these parts is sufficiently obvious, but they are
sometimes also present, without apparent function, on various parts
of the foot, as in <i>Discoglossus, Bombinator,</i> and <i>Pelodytes</i>. In some
species of the South American frogs of the genus <i>Leptodactylus</i> the
breast and hands are armed with very large spines, which inflict
deep wounds on the female held in embrace.</p>

<p>In most of the Caudata, the eggs are deposited singly in the axils
of water plants or on leaves which the female folds over the egg with
her hind limbs. The eggs are also deposited singly in some of the
lower Ecaudata. In many of the Ecaudata, and in a few of the
Caudata and Apoda, the eggs are laid in strings or bands which are
twined round aquatic plants or carried by the parent; whilst in
other Ecaudata they form large masses which either float on the
surface of the water or sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>A few batrachians retain the ova within the oviducts until the
young have undergone part or the whole of the metamorphosis.
Viviparous parturition is known among the Caudata (<i>Salamandra,
Spelerpes fuscus</i>), and the Apoda (<i>Dermophis thomensis, Typhlonectes
compressicauda</i>); also in a little toad (<i>Pseudophryne vivipara</i>) recently
discovered in German East Africa (<b>41</b>).</p>

<p><i>Development and Metamorphosis.</i>&mdash;In a great number of batrachians,
including most of the European species, the egg is small
and the food-yolk is in insufficient quantity to form an external
appendage of the embryo. But in a few European and North
American species, and in a great many inhabitants of the tropics,
the egg is large and a considerable portion of it persists for a long
time as a yolk-sac. Although the segmentation is always complete,
it is very irregular in these types, some of which make a distinct
approach to the meroblastic egg.</p>

<p>With the exception of a number of forms in which the whole
development takes place within the egg or in the body of the mother,
batrachians undergo metamorphoses, the young passing through
a free-swimming, gill-breathing period of considerable duration,
during which their appearance, structure, and often their <i>régime</i>,
are essentially different from those of the mature form. Even the
fossil Stegocephalia underwent metamorphosis, as we know from
various larval remains first described as <i>Branchiosaurus</i>. They are
less marked or more gradual in the Apoda and Caudata than in
Ecaudata, in which the stage known as tadpole is very unlike the
frog or toad into which it rather suddenly passes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tadpole</a></span>).
In the Caudata, external gills (three on each side) persist until the
close of the metamorphosis, whilst in the Apoda and Ecaudata
they exist only during the earlier periods, being afterwards replaced
by internal gills.</p>

<p>Many cases are known in which the young batrachian enters the
world in the perfect condition, as in the black salamander of the
Alps (<i>Salamandra atra</i>), the cave salamander (<i>Spelerpes fuscus</i>), the
caecinan <i>Typhlonectes</i>, and a number of frogs, such as <i>Pipa, Rhinoderma,
Hylodes,</i> some <i>Nototrema, Rana opisthodon,</i> &amp;c. A fairly
complete bibliographical index to these cases and the most remarkable
instances of parental care in tailless batrachians will be found
in the interesting articles by Lilian V. Sampson (<b>42</b>), and by G.
Brandes and W. Schoenichen (<b>43</b>). It will suffice to indicate here
in a synoptic form, as was done by the present writer many years
ago, when our knowledge of these wonders of batrachian life was
far less advanced than it is now, the principal modes of protection
which are resorted to:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Protection by means of nests or nurseries.</p>

<div class="list">
    <p>A. In enclosures in the water.&mdash;<i>Hylafaber</i>.</p>
    <p>B. In nests in holes near the water.&mdash;<i>Rhacophorus, Leptodactylus</i>.</p>
    <p>C. In nests overhanging the water.&mdash;<i>Rhacophorus, Chiromantis,
        Phyllpmedusa</i>.</p>
    <p>D. On trees or in moss away from the water.&mdash;<i>Rana opisthodon,
        Hylodes, Hylelia platycephala</i>.</p>
    <p>E. In a gelatinous bag in the water.&mdash;<i>Phrynixalus, Salamandrella</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>2. Direct nursing by the parents.</p>

<div class="list">
    <p>A Tadpoles transported from one place to another.&mdash;<i>Dendrebates,
        Phyllobates, Sooglossus</i>.</p>
    <p>B. Eggs protected by the parents who coil themselves round
        or &ldquo;sit&rdquo; on them.&mdash;<i>Mantophryne, Desmognathus,
        Autodax, Plethodon, Cryptobranchus, Amphiuma,
        Ichthyophis, Hypogeophis, Siphonops</i>.</p>
    <p>C. Eggs carried by the parents.</p>
</div>

<div class="list1">
        <p>(a) Round the legs, by the male.&mdash;<i>Alytes</i>.</p>
        <p>(b) On the back, by the female.</p>
</div>
<div class="list2">
            <p>(1) Exposed.&mdash;<i>Hyla goeldii, H. evansii, Ceratohyla</i>.</p>
            <p>(2) In cell-like pouches.&mdash;<i>Pipa</i>.</p>
            <p>(3) In a common pouch.&mdash;<i>Nototrema, Amphignathodon</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="list1">
        <p>(c) On the belly.</p>
</div>
<div class="list2">
            <p>(1) Exposed, by the female.&mdash;<i>Rhacophorus reticulatus</i>.</p>
            <p>(2) In a pouch (the produced vocal sac), by the
                male.&mdash;<i>Rhinoderma</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="list1">
        <p>(d) In the mouth, by the female.&mdash;<i>Hylambates brevirostris</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Geographical Distribution.</i>&mdash;If a division of the world according
to its batrachian faunae were to be attempted, it would differ very
considerably from that which would answer for the principal groups
of reptiles, the lizards especially. We should have four great
realms:&mdash;(1) Europe and Northern and Temperate Asia, Africa
north of the Sahara (palaearctic region) and North and Central
America (nearctic region); (2) Africa and South-Eastern Asia
(Ethiopian and Indian region); (3) South America (neotropical
region); and (4) Australia (Australian region). The first would be
characterized by the Caudata, which are almost confined to it
(although a few species penetrate into the Indian and neotropical
regions), the <i>Discoglossidae</i>, mostly Europaeo-Asiatic, but one genus
in California, and the numerous <i>Pelobatidae</i>; the second by the
presence of Apoda, the prevalence of firmisternal Ecaudata and the
absence of <i>Hylidae</i>; the third by the presence of Apoda, the prevalence
of arciferous Ecaudata and the scarcity of <i>Ranidae</i>, the
fourth by the prevalence of arciferous Ecaudata and the absence of
<i>Ranidae</i>, as well as by the absence of either Caudata or Apoda.
Madagascar might almost stand as a fifth division of the world,
characterized by the total absence of Caudata, Apoda, and arciferous
Ecaudata. But the close relation of its very rich frog-fauna to that
of the Ethiopian and Indian regions speaks against attaching too
great importance to these negative features. It may be noted here
that no two parts of the world differ so considerably in their Ecaudata
as do Madagascar and Australia, the former having only
Firmisternia, the latter only Arcifera. Although there is much
similarity between the Apoda of Africa and of South America, one
genus being even common to both parts of the world, the frogs are
extremely different, apart from the numerous representatives of
the widely distributed genus <i>Bufo</i>. It may be said that, on the whole,
the distribution of the batrachians agrees to some extent with that
of fresh-water fishes, except for the much less marked affinity
between South America and Africa, although even among the former
we have the striking example of the distribution of the very natural
group of the aglossal batrachians, represented by <i>Pipa</i> in South
America and by <i>Xenopus</i> and <i>Hymenochirus</i> in Africa.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTA,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> an Anglo-Indian military term, probably derived
from the Canarese <i>bhatta</i> (rice in the husk), meaning a special
allowance made to officers, soldiers, or other public servants in
the field.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTAGLIA,<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> a town of Venetia, Italy, in the province of
Padua, 11 m. S.S.W. by rail from Padua. Pop. (1901) 4456.
It lies at the edge of the volcanic Euganean Hills, and is noted
for its warm saline springs and natural vapour grotto. A fine
palace was erected in the Palladian style in the 17th century by
Marchese Benedetto Selvatico-Estense, then owner of the
springs.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTAKHIN,<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> African &ldquo;Arabs&rdquo; of Semitic stock. They
occupy the banks of the Blue Nile near Khartum, and it was
against them that General Gordon fought most of his battles
near the town. Their sheikh, El Obeid, routed Gordon&rsquo;s troops
on the 4th of September 1884, a defeat which led to the close
investment of Khartum. In the 18th century James Bruce
described them as &ldquo;a thieving, pilfering lot.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTALION,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> a unit of military organization consisting of four
or more companies of infantry. The term is used in nearly every
army, and is derived through Fr. from It. <i>battaglione</i>, Med. Lat.
<i>battalia</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Battle</a></span>). &ldquo;Battalion&rdquo; in the 16th and 17th centuries
implied a unit of infantry forming part of the line of battle,
but at first meant an unusually large <i>battalia</i> or a single large
body of men formed of several <i>battalias</i>. In the British regular
service the infantry battalion is commanded by a lieut.-colonel,
who is assisted by an adjutant, and consists at war strength of
about 1000 bayonets in eight companies. Engineers, train,
certain kinds of artillery, and more rarely cavalry are also
organized in battalions in some countries.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTAMBANG,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Battambong</span> (locally <i>Phralabong</i>), the
chief town of the north-western division of Cambodia, formerly
capital of Monton Kmer, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;The Cambodian Division,&rdquo; one of
the eastern provinces of Siam, now included in the French
protectorate of Cambodia. It is situated in 103° 6&prime; E., 13° 6&prime; N.,
in the midst of a fertile plain and on the river Sang Ke, which
flows eastwards and falls into the Tonle or Talé Sap, the great
lake of Cambodia. The town is a collection of bamboo houses of
no importance, but there is a walled enceinte of some historical
interest. Trade is small and is carried on by Chinese settlers,
chiefly overland with Bangkok, but to a small extent also by
water with Saigon. The population is about 5000, two-thirds
Cambodian and the remainder Chinese and Siamese. The
language is Cambodian.</p>

<p>Battambang was taken by the Siamese when they overran
the kingdom of Cambodia towards the end of the 18th century,
and was recognized by the French as belonging to Siam when
the frontier of Cambodia was adjusted by treaty in 1867-1872.
In another treaty in 1893, Siam bound herself to maintain no
armed forces there other than police, but this arrangement was
annulled by the treaty of 1904, by which Battambang was
definitely admitted to lie within the French sphere of influence.
Under a further treaty in March 1907 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Siam</a></span>), the district of
Battambang was finally ceded to the French.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATTANNI,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bhitani</span>, a small tribe on the Waziri border of
the North-West Frontier Province of India. The Battannis
hold the hills on the borders of Tank and Bannu in the Dera
Ismail Khan district, from the Gabar mountain on the north to
the Gomal valley on the south. They are only 3000 fighting
men strong, and are generally regarded as the jackals of the
Waziris. Their chief importance arises from the fact that no
raids can be carried into British districts by the Mahsud Waziris
without passing through Battanni territory. A small British
expedition against the Battannis was led by Lt.-Col. Rynd
in 1880. Under the excitement caused by the preaching of a
fanatical mullah the Mahsud Waziris had attacked the town of
Gomal. The Battannis failed to supply information as to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page530" id="page530"></a>530</span>
movements, and gave them a passage through their lands. The
British troops accordingly stormed the Hinis Tangi defile in face
of opposition, and burned the village of Jandola.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATTAS<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (Dutch <i>Battaks</i>), the inhabitants of the formerly
independent Batta country, in the central highlands of Sumatra,
now for the most part subjugated to the Dutch government.
The still independent area extends from 98°-99° 35&prime; E., and
2°-3° 25&prime; S. North-east of Toba Lake dwell the Timor Battas,
and west of it the Pakpak, but on its north (in the mountains
which border on the east coast residency) the Karo Battas form
a special group, which, by its dialects and ethnological character,
appears to be allied to the Gajus and Allas occupying the interior
of Achin. The origin of the Battas is doubtful. It is not known
whether they were settled in Sumatra before the Hindu period.
Their language contains words of Sanskrit origin and others
referable to Javanese, Malay and Tagal influence. Their domain
has been doubtless much curtailed, and their absorption into the
Achin and Malay population seems to have been long going on.
The Battas are undoubtedly of Malayan stock, and by most
authorities are affiliated to that Indonesian pre-Malayan race
which peopled the Indian Archipelago, expelling the aboriginal
negritos, and in turn themselves submitting to the civilized
Malays. In many points the Battas are physically quite different
from the Malay type. The average height of the men is 5 ft.
4 in.; of the women 4 ft. 8 in. In general build they are rather
thickset, with broad shoulders and fairly muscular limbs. The
colour of the skin ranges from dark brown to a yellowish tint,
the darkness apparently quite independent of climatic influences
or distinction of race. The skull is rather oval than round. In
marked contrast to the Malay type are the large, black, long-shaped
eyes, beneath heavy, black or dark brown eyebrows. The
cheek-bones are somewhat prominent, but less so than among the
Malays. The Battas are dirty in their dress and dwellings and
eat any kind of food, though they live chiefly on rice. They are
remarkable as a people who in many ways are cultured and
possess a written language of their own, and yet are cannibals.
The more civilized of them around Lake Toba are good agriculturists
and stock-breeders, and understand iron-smelting.
They weave and dye cotton, make jewellery and krisses which are
often of exquisite workmanship, bake pottery, and build picturesque
chalet-like houses of two storeys. They have an organized
government, hereditary chiefs, popular assemblies, and a
written civil and penal code. There is even an antiquated postal
system, the letter-boxes being the hollow tree trunks at crossroads.
Yet in spite of this comparative culture the Battas have
long been notorious for the most revolting forms of cannibalism.
(See <i>Memoirs of the Life, &amp;c., of Sir T.S. Raffles</i>, 1830.)</p>

<p>The Battas are the only lettered people of the Indian Archipelago
who are not Mahommedans. Their religion is mainly
confined to a belief in evil spirits; but they recognize three
gods, a Creator, a Preserver and a Destroyer, a trinity suggestive
of Hindu influence.</p>

<p>Up to the publication of Dr H.N. van der Tuuk&rsquo;s essay, <i>Over
schrift en uitspraak der Tobasche taal</i> (1855), our knowledge
of the Batta language was confined to lists of words more or less complete,
chiefly to be found in W. Marsden&rsquo;s <i>Miscellaneous Works</i>,
in F.W. Junghuhn&rsquo;s <i>Battalander</i>, and in the <i>Tijdschrift
van het Bataviaasch Genootschap</i>, vol. iii. (1855). By his
exhaustive works (<i>Bataksch Leesboek</i>, in 4 vols., 1861-1862;
<i>Bataksch-nederduitsch Woordenboek</i>, 1861; <i>Tobasche Spraakkunst,</i> 1864-1867)
van der Tuuk made the Batta language the most accessible of
the various tongues spoken in Sumatra. According to him, it is
nearest akin to the old Javanese and Tagal, but A. Schreiber
(<i>Die Battas in ihrem Verhältnis zu den Malaien von Sumatra</i>,
1874) endeavoured to prove its closer affinity with the Malay
proper. Like most languages spoken by less civilized tribes,
Batta is poor in general terms, but abounds in terms for special
objects. The number of dialects is three, viz. the Toba, the
Mandailing and the Dairi dialects; the first and second have
again two subdivisions each. The Battas further possess six
peculiar or recondite modes of speech, such as the <i>hata andung</i>,
or language of the wakes, and the <i>hata poda</i> or the soothsayer&rsquo;s language. A fair acquaintance with reading and writing is very general among them. Their alphabet is said, with the Rejang
and Lampong alphabets, to be of Indian origin. The language
is written on bark or bamboo staves from bottom to top, the
lines being arranged from left to right. The literature consists
chiefly in books on witchcraft, in stories, riddles, incantations,
&amp;c., and is mostly in prose, occasionally varied by verse.<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p><span class="bold">BATTEN, SIR WILLIAM<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (<i>floruit</i> 1626-1667), British sailor,
son of Andrew Batten, master in the royal navy, first appears as
taking out letters of marque in 1626, and in 1638 he obtained the
post of surveyor to the navy, probably by purchase. In March
1642 he was appointed second-in-command under the earl of
Warwick, the parliamentary admiral who took the fleet out of
the king&rsquo;s hands. It was Vice-Admiral Batten&rsquo;s squadron which
bombarded Scarborough when Henrietta Maria landed there.
He was accused (it appears unjustly) by the Royalists of directing
his fire particularly on the house occupied by the queen, and up
to the end of the First Civil War showed himself a steady partisan
of the parliament. To the end of the First Civil War, Batten
continued to patrol the English seas, and his action in 1647 in
bringing into Portsmouth a number of Swedish ships of war and
merchantmen, which had refused the customary salute to the
flag, was approved by parliament. When the Second Civil War
began he was distrusted by the Independents and removed from
his command, though he confessed his continued willingness to
serve the state. When part of the fleet revolted against the
parliament, and joined the prince of Wales in Holland, May
1648, Batten went with them. He was knighted by the prince,
but being suspected by the Royalists, was put ashore mutinously
in Holland and returned to England. He lived in retirement
during the Commonwealth period. At the Restoration Sir
William Batten became once more surveyor of the navy. In this
office he was in constant intercourse with Pepys, whose diary
frequently mentions him; but the insinuations of Pepys against
him must not be taken too seriously, as there is no evidence to
show that Batten in making a profit from his office fell below the
standards of the time. In 1661 he became M.P. for Rochester,
and in 1663 he was made master of the Trinity House. He died
in 1667.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There is no separate life of Batten, but many notices of him will
be found in Penn&rsquo;s <i>Life of Sir W. Penn</i>, and in Pepys&rsquo; <i>Diary</i>.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTENBERG,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> the name of a family of German counts which
died out about 1314, whose seat was the castle of Kellerburg, near
Battenberg, a small place now in the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau.
The title was revived in 1851, when Alexander (1823-1888),
a younger son of Louis II., grand-duke of Hesse, contracted
a morganatic marriage with a Polish lady, Countess Julia Theresa
von Haucke (1825-1895), who was then created countess of
Battenberg. Raised to the rank of a princess in 1858, the countess
and her children were allowed to style themselves princes and
princesses of Battenberg, with the addition of <i>Durchlaucht</i> or
Serene Highness. The eldest son of this union, Louis Alexander
(b. 1854), married in 1884 Victoria, daughter of Louis IV., grand-duke
of Hesse, and became an admiral in the British navy. The
second son, Alexander Joseph (<i>q.v.</i>), was prince of Bulgaria from
1879 to 1886. The third son, Henry Maurice, was born in 1858,
and married on the 23rd of July 1885 Beatrice, youngest
daughter of Victoria, queen of England. He died at sea on the
20th of January 1896 when returning from active service with the
British troops during the Ashanti War, and left three sons and a
daughter, Victoria Eugénie, who was married in 1906 to Alphonso
XIII., king of Spain. The fourth son, Francis Joseph, born in
1861, married in 1897 Anna, daughter of Nicholas I., prince of
Montenegro, and is the author of <i>Die volkswirtschaftliche
Entwickelung Bulgariens von 1879 bis zur Gegenwart</i> (Leipzig,
1891). The only daughter of the princess of Battenberg, Marie
Caroline, born in 1852, was married in 1871 to Gustavus Ernest,
prince and count of Erbach-Schönberg.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTER,<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> an architectural term of unknown origin, used of
the face of a wall which is slightly inclined to the perpendicular.
It is most commonly employed in retaining walls, the lower
courses of which are laid at right angles to the batter, so as to
resist the thrust of the earth inside. For aesthetic reasons it is
often adopted in the lowest or basement porticos of a great
building. From a historical point of view it is the most ancient
system employed, as throughout Egypt and Chaldaea all the
temples built in unburnt brick were perforce obliged to be thicker
at the bottom, and this gave rise to the batter or raking side which
was afterwards in Egypt copied in stone. For defensive purposes
the walls of the lower portions of a fortress were built with a batter
as in the case of the tower of David and some of the walls built by
Herod at Jerusalem. The Crusaders also largely adopted the
principle, which was followed in some of the castles of the middle
ages throughout Europe.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTERING RAM<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (Lat. <i>aries</i>, ram), a military engine used
before the invention of cannon, for beating down the walls of
besieged fortresses. It consisted of a long heavy beam of timber,
armed at the extremity with iron fashioned something like the
head of a ram. In its simplest form the beam was carried in the
hands of the soldiers, who assailed the walls with it by main force.
The improved ram was composed of a longer beam, in some cases
extending to 120 ft., shod with iron at one end, and suspended,
either by the middle or from two points, from another beam laid
across two posts. This is the kind described by Josephus as
having been used at the siege of Jerusalem (<i>B.J.</i> iii. 7. 19). The
ram was shielded from the missiles of the besieged by a penthouse
(<i>vinea</i>) or other overhead protection. It was often mounted on
wheels, which greatly facilitated its operations. A hundred
soldiers at a time, and sometimes even a greater number, were
employed to work it, and the parties were relieved in constant
succession. No wall could resist the continued application of the
ram, and the greatest efforts were always made to destroy it by
various means, such as dropping heavy stones on the head of the
ram and on the roof of the penthouse; another method being to
seize the ram head with grapnels and then haul it up to a vertical
position by suitable windlasses on the wall of the fortress.
Sometimes the besieged ran countermines under the ram penthouse;
this if successful would cause the whole engine to fall into
the excavation. In medieval warfare the low penthouse, called
<i>cat</i>, was generally employed with some form of ram.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTERSEA,<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> a south-western metropolitan borough of
London, England, bounded N. by the Thames, N.E. by Lambeth,
and S.E., S., and W. by Wandsworth. Pop. (1901) 168,907.
The principal thoroughfares are Wandsworth Road and Battersea
Park and York Roads from east to west, connected north and
south with the Victoria or Chelsea, Albert and Battersea bridges
over the Thames. The two first of these three are handsome
suspension bridges; the third, an iron structure, replaced a
wooden bridge of many arches which was closed in 1881, after
standing a little over a century. Battersea is a district mainly
consisting of artisans&rsquo; houses, and there are several large factories
by the river. The parish church of St Mary, Church Road (1776),
preserves from an earlier building stained glass and monuments,
including one to Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke (d. 1751),
and his second wife, who had a mansion close by. Of this a portion
remains on the riverside, containing a room associated with Pope,
who is said to have worked here upon the &ldquo;Essay on Man.&rdquo;
Wandsworth Common and Clapham Common (220 acres) lie
partly within the borough, but the principal public recreation
ground is Battersea Park, bordering the Thames between Albert
and Victoria Bridges, beautifully laid out, containing a lake and
subtropical garden, and having an area of nearly 200 acres. It
was constructed with difficulty by embanking the river and
raising the level of the formerly marshy ground, and was opened
in 1858. Among institutions are the Battersea Polytechnic, the
Royal Masonic Institution for girls, founded in 1788, and Church
of England and Wesleyan Training Colleges. Battersea is in the
parliamentary borough of Battersea and Clapham, including the
whole of the Battersea division and part of the Clapham division.
The borough council consists of a mayor, 9 aldermen and 54
councillors. Area, 2160.3 acres.</p>

<p>An early form of the name is <i>Patricsey</i> or Peter&rsquo;s Island; the
manor at the time of the Domesday survey, and until the suppression
of the monasteries, belonging to the abbey of St Peter,
Westminster. It next passed to the crown, and subsequently to
the family of St John and to the earls Spencer. York Road
recalls the existence of a palace of the archbishops of York,
occasionally occupied by them between the reigns of Edward IV.
and Mary. Battersea Fields, bordering the river, were formerly
a favourite resort, so that the park also perpetuates a memory.
The art of enamelling was introduced, <i>c.</i> 1750, at works in Battersea,
examples from which are highly valued.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTERY<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (Fr. <i>batterie</i>, from <i>battre</i>, to beat), the action of
beating, especially in law the unlawful wounding of another (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Assault</a></span>). The term is applied to the apparatus used in battering,
hence its use in military organization for the unit of mobile
artillery of all kinds. This consists of from four to eight guns
with their <i>personnel</i>, wagons and train. In the British service
the term is applied to field, horse, field-howitzer, heavy and
mountain artillery units. &ldquo;Battery&rdquo; is also used to imply a
mass of guns in action, especially in connexion with the military
history of the 18th and early 19th centuries. In siegecraft, a
battery is simply an emplacement for guns, howitzers or mortars,
constructed for the purposes of the siege, and protected as a rule
by a parapet. In fortification the term is applied similarly to
permanent or semi-permanent emplacements for the artillery of
the defence. In all these senses the presence of artillery is implied
in the use of the word (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Artillery</a></span>, and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fortification and
Siegecraft</a></span>). The word is also used for the &ldquo;pitcher&rdquo; and
&ldquo;catcher&rdquo; in baseball; for a collection of utensils, primarily
of hammered copper or brass, especially in the French term
<i>batterie de cuisine</i>; and for the instruments of percussion in an
orchestra.</p>

<p><i>Electric Battery</i>&mdash;This term was applied by the old electricians
to a collection of Leyden jars, but is now used of a device for
generating electricity by chemical action, or more exactly, of a
number of such devices joined up together. There are two main
classes of electric battery. In <i>primary</i> batteries, composed of a
number of galvanic or voltaic &ldquo;cells,&rdquo; &ldquo;couples&rdquo; or &ldquo;elements,&rdquo;
on the completion of the interactions between the substances on
which the production of electricity depends, the activity of the
cells comes to an end, and can only be restored with the aid of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page532" id="page532"></a>532</span>
a fresh supply of those substances; in <i>secondary</i> batteries, also
called storage batteries or accumulators (<i>q.v.</i>), the substances
after the exhaustion of the cells can be brought back to a condition
in which they will again yield an electric current, by means
of an electric current passed through them in the reverse direction.
The first primary battery was constructed about 1799 by
Alessandro Volta. In one form, the &ldquo;voltaic pile,&rdquo; he placed a
series of pairs of copper and zinc disks one above the other,
separating each pair from the one above it by a piece of cloth
moistened with a solution of common salt. In another form, the
&ldquo;couronne de tasses,&rdquo; he took a number of vessels or cells containing
brine or dilute acid, and placed in each a zinc plate and a
copper plate; these plates were not allowed to touch each other
within the vessels, but each zinc plate was connected to the
copper plate of the adjoining vessel. In both these arrangements
an electric current passes through a wire which is connected to
the terminal plates at the two ends of the series. The direction
of this current is from copper to zinc; within each cell itself it
is from zinc to copper. The plate to which the current flows
within the cell is the <i>negative plate</i>, and that from which it flows
the <i>positive plate</i>; but the point on the negative plate at which
the current enters the external wire is the <i>positive pole</i>, and the
point on the positive plate at which it leaves the external circuit
the <i>negative pole</i>. During the time that the external connexion is
maintained between the two poles and the current passes in
the wire, the zinc or positive plates are gradually dissolved, and
hydrogen gas is liberated at the surface of the copper or negative
plates; but when the external connexion is broken this action
ceases. If the materials used in the cells were perfectly pure,
probably the cessation would be complete. In practice, however,
only impure commercial zinc is available, and with this corrosion
continues to some extent, even though the external circuit is
not closed, thus entailing waste of material. This &ldquo;local action&rdquo;
is explained as due to the fact that the impurities in the zinc
plate form miniature voltaic couples with the zinc itself, thus
causing its corrosion by voltaic action; and an early improvement
in the voltaic cell was the discovery, applied by W. Sturgeon
in 1830, that the evil was greatly reduced if the surface of the zinc
plates was amalgamated, by being rubbed with mercury under
dilute sulphuric acid. Another disadvantage of the simple cell
composed of copper and zinc in dilute acid is that the current it
yields rapidly falls off. The hydrogen formed by the operation
of the cell does not all escape, but some adheres as a film to the
negative plate, and the result is the establishment of a counter
or reverse electromotive force which opposes the main current
flowing from the zinc plate and diminishes its force. This phenomenon
is known as &ldquo;polarization,&rdquo; and various remedies have
been tried for the evils it introduces in the practical use of
primary batteries. Alfred Smee in 1839 modified the simple
copper-zinc couple excited by dilute sulphuric acid by
substituting for the copper thin leaves of platinum or platinized
silver, whereby the elimination of the hydrogen is facilitated;
and attempts have also been made to keep the plates free from
the gas by mechanical agitation. The plan usually adopted,
however, is either to prevent the formation of the film, or to
introduce into the cell some &ldquo;depolarizer&rdquo; which will destroy
it as it is formed by oxidizing the hydrogen to water (see also
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrolysis</a></span>).</p>

<p>The former method is exemplified in the cell invented by
J.F. Daniell in 1836. Here the zinc stands in dilute sulphuric
acid (or in a solution of zinc sulphate), and the copper in a
saturated solution of copper sulphate, the two liquids being
separated by a porous partition. The hydrogen formed by the
action of the cell replaces copper in the copper sulphate, and the
displaced copper, instead of the hydrogen, being deposited on the
copper plate polarization is avoided. The electromotive force is
about one volt. This cell has been constructed in a variety of
forms to suit different purposes. In a portable form, designed
by Lord Kelvin in 1858, the copper plate, soldered to a gutta-percha
covered wire, is placed at the bottom of a glass vessel
and covered with crystals of copper sulphate; over these wet
sawdust is sprinkled, and then mere sawdust, moistened with
solution of zinc sulphate, upon which is placed the zinc plate.
The Minotto cell is similar, except that sand is substituted for
sawdust. In these batteries the sawdust or sand takes the place
of the porous diaphragm. In another class of batteries the
diaphragm is dispensed with altogether, and the action of gravity
alone is relied upon to retard the interdiffusion of the liquids.
The cell of J.H. Meidinger, invented in 1859, may be taken as
a type of this class. The zinc is formed into a ring which fits
the upper part of a glass beaker filled with zinc sulphate solution.
At the bottom of the beaker is placed a smaller beaker, in which
stands a ring of copper with an insulated connecting wire. The
mouth of the beaker is closed by a lid with a hole in the centre,
through which passes the long tapering neck of a glass balloon
filled with crystals of copper sulphate; the narrow end of this
neck dips into the smaller beaker, the copper sulphate slowly
runs out, and being specifically heavier than the zinc sulphate it
collects at the bottom about the copper ring. In Lord Kelvin&rsquo;s
tray-cell a large wooden tray is lined with lead, and is covered
at the bottom with copper by electrotyping. The zinc plate is
enveloped in a piece of parchment paper bent into a tray shape,
the whole resting on little pieces of wood placed on the bottom
of the leaden tray. Copper sulphate is fed in at the edge of the
tray and zinc sulphate is poured upon the parchment. A
battery is formed by arranging the trays in a stack one above
the other.</p>

<p>Various combinations have been devised in which the hydrogen
is got rid of more or less completely by oxidation. Sir W.R.
Grove in 1839 employed nitric acid as the oxidizing agent, his
cell consisting of a zinc positive plate in dilute sulphuric acid,
separated by a porous diaphragm of unglazed earthenware from
a platinum negative immersed in concentrated nitric acid. Its
electromotive force is nearly two volts, but it has the objection of
giving off disagreeable nitrous fumes. R.W. von Bunsen modified
Grove&rsquo;s cell by replacing the platinum with the much cheaper
material, gas carbon. Chromic acid is much used as a depolarizer,
and cells in which it is employed are about as powerful
as, and more convenient than, either of the preceding. In its
two-fluid form the chromic acid cell consists of a porous pot
containing amalgamated zinc in dilute sulphuric acid, and a
carbon plate surrounded with sulphuric acid and a solution of
potassium or sodium bichromate or of chromic acid. But it is
commonly used in a one-fluid form, the porous pot being dispensed
with, and both zinc and carbon immersed in the chromic
acid solution. Since the zinc is dissolved even when the circuit
is not closed, arrangements are frequently provided by which
either the zinc plate alone or both plates can be lifted out of the
solution when the cell is not in use. In preparing the solution
the sodium salt is preferable to the potassium, and chromic acid
to either. In the cell devised by Georges Leclanché in 1868 a
solid depolarizer is employed, in the shape of manganese dioxide
packed with fragments of carbon into a porous pot round a
carbon plate. A zinc rod constitutes the positive plate, and the
exciting fluid is a solution of sal-ammoniac. Sometimes no
porous pot is employed, and the manganese dioxide and granulated
carbon are agglomerated into a solid block round the
carbon plate. The electromotive force is about one and a half
volt. The cell is widely used for such purposes as ringing electric
bells, where current is required intermittently, and for such
service it will remain effective for months or years, only needing
water to be added to the outer jar occasionally to replace loss by
evaporation. On a closed circuit the current rapidly falls off,
because the manganese dioxide is unable to oxidize all the
hydrogen formed, but the cell quickly recovers after polarization.
The so-called &ldquo;dry cells,&rdquo; which came into considerable use
towards the end of the 19th century, are essentially Leclanché
cells in which the solution is present, not as a liquid, but as
a paste formed with some absorbent material or gelatinized.
Black oxide of copper is another solid depolarizer, employed in
the Lalande cell. In the Edison-Lalande form the copper oxide
is suspended in a light copper frame. The exciting solution
consists of one part of caustic soda dissolved in three parts by
weight of water, and to prevent it from being acted on by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page533" id="page533"></a>533</span>
carbonic acid of the air it is covered with a layer of petroleum
oil. Sodium zincate, which is soluble, is formed by the action
of the cell, and the hydrogen produced is oxidized by oxygen
from the copper oxide. The electromotive force may be about
one volt initially, but in practice only about three-quarters of a
volt can be relied on.</p>

<p>Primary cells form a convenient means of obtaining electricity
for laboratory experiments, and for such light services as working
telegraphs, bells, &amp;c.; but as a source of the heavy currents
required for electric lighting and traction they are far too
expensive in operation, apart from other considerations, to
compete with dynamoelectric machinery driven by steam or
water power. Certain forms, known as &ldquo;standard cells,&rdquo; are
also used in electrical measurements as standards of electromotive
force (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Potentiometer</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATTEUX, CHARLES<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1713-1780), French philosopher and
writer on aesthetics, was born near Vouziers (Ardennes), and
studied theology at Reims. In 1739 he came to Paris, and after
teaching in the colleges of Lisieux and Navarre, was appointed
to the chair of Greek and Roman philosophy in the Collège de
France. In 1746 he published his treatise <i>Les Beaux-Arts réduits
à un même principe</i>, an attempt to find a unity among the various
theories of beauty and taste, and his views were widely accepted.
The reputation thus gained, confirmed by his translation of
Horace (1750), led to his becoming a member of the Académie
des Inscriptions (1754) and of the French Academy (1761). His
<i>Cours de belles lettres</i> (1765) was afterwards included with some
minor writings in the large treatise, <i>Principes de la liltérature</i>
(1774). The rules for composition there laid down are, perhaps,
somewhat pedantic. His philosophical writings were <i>La Morale
d&rsquo;Épicure tirée de ses propres écrits</i> (1758), and the <i>Histoire des
causes premières</i> (1769). In consequence of the freedom with
which in this work he attacked the abuse of authority in philosophy,
he lost his professorial chair. His last and most extensive
work was a <i>Cours d&rsquo;études à l&rsquo;usage des élèves de l&rsquo;école militaire</i>
(45 vols.). In the <i>Beaux-Arts</i>, Batteux developed a theory which
is derived from Locke through Voltaire&rsquo;s sceptical sensualism.
He held that Art consists in the faithful imitation of the beautiful
in nature. Applying this principle to the art of poetry, and
analysing, line by line and even word by word, the works of
great poets, he deduced the law that the beauty of poetry consists
in the accuracy, beauty and harmony of individual expression.
This narrow and pedantic theory had at least the merit of
insisting on propriety of expression. His <i>Histoire des causes
premières</i> was among the first attempts at a history of philosophy,
and in his work on Epicurus, following on Gassendi, he defended
Epicureanism against the general attacks made against it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATTHYANY, LOUIS<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> <span class="sc">(Lajos), Count</span> (1806-1849), Hungarian
statesman, was born at Pressburg in 1806. He supplied the
defects of an indifferent education while serving in garrison in
Italy as a lieutenant of hussars, and thenceforward adopted
all the new ideas, economical and political. According to
Széchenyi, he learnt much from a German tutor of the radical
school, but it was not till after his marriage with the noble-minded
and highly-gifted countess Antonia Zichy that he began
working earnestly for the national cause. When Széchenyi
drew nearer to the court in 1839-1840, Batthyány became the
leader of the opposition in the Upper House, where his social
rank and resolute character won for him great influence. Despite
his &ldquo;sardanapalian inclinations,&rdquo; he associated himself unreservedly
with the extremists, and spent large sums for the
development of trade and industry. In 1847 he fiercely opposed
the government, procured the election of Kossuth as the representative
of Pest, took part in the Great Deputation of the 15th
of March, and on the 31st of March 1848 became the first
constitutional prime-minister of Hungary. His position became
extremely difficult when Jellachich and the Croats took up
arms. Convinced that the rigid maintenance of the constitution
was the sole panacea, he did his utmost, in his frequent journeys
to Innsbruck, to persuade the court to condemn Jellachich and
establish a strong national government at Pest. Unfortunately,
however, he was persuaded to consent to the despatch of Magyar
troops to quell the Italian rising, before the Croat difficulty had
been adjusted, and thenceforth, despite his perfect loyalty,
and his admirable services as Honvéd minister in organizing the
national forces, his authority in Hungary declined before the
rising star of Kossuth. When Jellachich invaded Hungary,
Batthyány resigned with the intention of forming a new ministry
excluding Kossuth, but this had now become impossible. Then
Batthyány attempted to mediate between the two extreme
parties, and subsequently raised a regiment from among his
peasantry and led them against the Croats. On the 11th of
October he was incapacitated for active service by a fall from
his horse which broke his arm. On his recovery he returned to
Pest, laboured hard to bring about peace, and was a member of
the deputation from the Hungarian diet to Prince Windischgrätz,
whom the Austrian commander refused to receive. A few days
later (8th of January 1849) he was arrested at Pest. As a
magnate he was only indictable by the grand justiciary, as a
minister he was responsible to the diet alone. At Laibach,
whither he was taken, he asked that Deák might be his advocate,
but this being refused he wrote his own defence. Sentence of
hanging was finally pronounced upon him at Olmtitz for violating
the Pragmatic Sanction, overthrowing the constitution, and
aiding and abetting the rebellion. To escape this fate he
Stabbed himself with a small concealed dagger, and bled to
death in the night of the 5th of October 1849.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATTLE,<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> a general engagement between the armed forces,
naval or military, of enemies. The word is derived from the
Fr. <i>bataille</i>, and this, like the Ital. <i>battaglia</i>, and Span.
<i>batalla</i>, comes from the popular Lat. <i>battalia</i> for <i>battualia</i>.
Cassiodorus Senator (480-?575) says: <i>Battualia quae vulgo
Batalia dicuntur ... exercitationes militum vel gladiatorum
significant</i> (see Du Cange, <i>Glossarium</i>, s.v. <i>Batalia</i>). The verb
<i>battuere</i>, cognate with &ldquo;beat,&rdquo; is a rare word, found in Pliny, used
of beating in a mortar or of meat before cooking. Suetonius
(<i>Caligula</i>, 54-32) uses it of fencing, <i>battuebat pugnatoriis armis,</i> <i>i.e.</i>
not with blunted weapons or foils. <i>Battalia</i> or <i>batalia</i> was used
for the array of troops for battle, and hence was applied to the
body of troops so arranged, or to a division of an army, whence the
use of the word &ldquo;battalion&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>A &ldquo;pitched battle,&rdquo; loosely used as meaning almost a decisive
engagement, is strictly, as the words imply, one that is fought on
ground previously selected (&ldquo;pitched&rdquo; meaning arranged in a
fixed order) and in accordance with the intentions of the commanders
of both sides; the French equivalent is <i>bataille arrangée</i>,
opposed to <i>bataille man&oelig;uvrée</i>, which is prearranged but may
come off on any ground. With &ldquo;battle,&rdquo; in its usual meaning of
a general engagement of hostile forces, are contrasted &ldquo;skirmish,&rdquo;<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
a fight between small bodies (&ldquo;skirmishing&rdquo; technically
means fighting by troops in extended or irregular order), and
&ldquo;action,&rdquo; a more or less similar engagement between large
bodies of troops. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tactics</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Strategy</a></span>.)</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1e" id="ft1e" href="#fa1e"><span class="fn">1</span></a> This is the same word as &ldquo;scrimmage,&rdquo; and is derived from the
Anglo-French <i>eskrimir</i>, modern <i>escrimer</i>, properly to fight behind
cover, now to fence. The origin of this is the Old High German
<i>scirman</i>, to fight behind a shield, <i>scirm</i>. Modern German <i>Schirm</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATTLE ABBEY ROLL<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span>. This is popularly supposed to have
been a list of William the Conqueror&rsquo;s companions preserved at
Battle Abbey, on the site of his great victory over Harold. It is
known to us only from 16th century versions of it published by
Leland, Holinshed and Duchesne, all more or less imperfect and
corrupt. Holinshed&rsquo;s is much the fullest, but of its 629 names
several are duplicates. The versions of Leland and Duchesne,
though much shorter, each contain many names found in neither
of the other lists. It was so obvious that several of the names had
no right to figure on the roll, that Camden, as did Dugdale after
him, held them to have been interpolated at various times by the
monks, &ldquo;not without their own advantage.&rdquo; Modern writers
have gone further, Sir Egerton Brydges denouncing the roll as &ldquo;a
disgusting forgery,&rdquo; and E.A. Freeman dismissing it as &ldquo;a
transparent fiction.&rdquo; An attempt to vindicate the roll was made
by the last duchess of Cleveland, whose <i>Battle Abbey Roll</i>
(3 vols., 1889) is the best guide to its contents.</p>

<p>It is probable that the character of the roll has been quite
misunderstood. It is not a list of individuals, but only of family
surnames, and it seems to have been intended to show which
families had &ldquo;come over with the Conqueror,&rdquo; and to have been
compiled about the 14th century. The compiler appears to have
been influenced by the French sound of names, and to have
included many families of later settlement, such as that of
Grandson, which did not come to England from Savoy till two
centuries after the Conquest. The roll itself appears to be
unheard of before and after the 16th century, but other lists were
current at least as early as the 15th century, as the duchess of
Cleveland has shown. In 1866 a list of the Conqueror&rsquo;s followers,
compiled from Domesday and other authentic records, was set up
in Dives church by M. Leopold Delisle, and is printed in the
duchess&rsquo; work. Its contents are naturally sufficient to show
that the Battle Roll is worthless.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATTLE CREEK,<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> a city of Calhoun county, Michigan, U.S.A.,
at the confluence of the Kalamazoo river with Battle Creek, about
48 m. S. of Grand Rapids. Pop. (1890) 13,197; (1900) 18,563,
of whom 1844 were foreign-born; (1910, census) 25,267. It is
served by the Michigan Central and the Grand Trunk railways,
and by interurban electric lines. Here are the hospital and
laboratories of the American Medical Missionary College (of
Chicago) and the Battle Creek Sanitarium, established in 1866,
which was a pioneer in dietetic reform, and did much to make
Battle Creek important in the manufacture of health foods, and
in the publication of diet-reform literature. Among the principal
buildings, besides the hospital and the sanitarium, are several
fine churches, the central high school, the Post tavern and the
Post theatre. The city is a trading centre for the rich agricultural
and fruit-growing district by which it is surrounded, has
good water-power, and is an important manufacturing centre, its
chief manufactured products being cereal health foods, for which
it has a wide reputation, and the manufacture of which grew out
of the dietetic experiments made in the laboratories of the
sanitarium; and threshing machines and other agricultural
implements, paper cartons and boxes, flour, boilers, engines and
pumps. Extensive locomotive and car shops of the Grand Trunk
railway are here. In 1904 the total factory product of Battle
Creek was valued at $12,298,244, an increase of 95% over
that for 1900; and of the total in 1904 $5,191,655 was the value
of food preparations, which was 8.5% of the value of food
preparations manufactured in the United States, Battle Creek
thus ranking first among American cities in this industry. The
water-works are owned and operated by the municipality, the
water being obtained from Lake Goguac, a summer pleasure
resort about 2 m. from the city. Battle Creek, said to have been
named from hostilities here between some surveyors and
Indians, was settled in 1831, incorporated as a village in 1850,
and chartered as a city in 1859, the charter of that year being
revised in 1900.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATTLEDORE AND SHUTTLECOCK,<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> a game played by two
persons with small rackets, called battledores, made of parchment
or rows of gut stretched across wooden frames, and shuttlecocks,
made of a base of some light material, like cork, with trimmed
feathers fixed round the top. The object of the players is to bat
the shuttlecock from one to the other as many times as possible
without allowing it to fall to the ground. There are Greek
drawings extant representing a game almost identical with
battledore and shuttlecock, and it has been popular in China,
Japan, India and Siam for at least 2000 years. In Europe it has
been played by children for centuries. A further development is
Badminton.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTLEMENT<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (probably from a lost Fr. form <i>bastillement</i>, cf.
mod. Fr. <i>bastille</i>, from Med. Lat. <i>bastilia</i>, towers, which is derived
from Ital. <i>bastire</i>, to build, cf. Fr. <i>bâtir</i>; the English word was,
however, early connected with &ldquo;battle&rdquo;), a term given to a
parapet of a wall, in which portions have been cut out at intervals
to allow the discharge of arrows or other missiles; these cut-out
portions are known as &ldquo;crenels&rdquo;; the solid widths between the
&ldquo;crenels&rdquo; are called &ldquo;merlons.&rdquo; The earliest example in the
palace at Medinet-Abu at Thebes in Egypt is of the inverted
form, and is said to have been derived from Syrian fortresses.
Through Assyria they formed the termination of all the walls
surrounding the towns, as shown on bas reliefs from Nimrud and
elsewhere. Traces of them have been found at Mycenae, and
they are suggested on Greek vases. In the battlements of
Pompeii, additional protection was given by small internal
buttresses or spur walls against which the defender might place
himself so as to be protected completely on one side. In the
battlements of the middle ages the crenel was about one-third
of the width of the merlon, and the latter was in addition pierced
with a small slit. The same is also found in Italian battlements,
where the merlon is of much greater height and is capped in a
peculiar fashion. The battlements of the Mahommedans had a
more decorative and varied character, and were retained from
the 13th century onwards not so much for defensive purposes as
for a crowning feature to their walls. They may be regarded
therefore in the same light as the cresting found in the Spanish
renaissance. The same retention of the battlement as a purely
decorative feature is found throughout the Decorated and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page535" id="page535"></a>535</span>
Perpendicular periods, and not only occurs on parapets but
on the transoms of windows and on the tie-beams of roofs and
on screens. A further decorative treatment was given in the
elaborate panelling of the merlons and that portion of the
parapet walls rising above the cornice, by the introduction of
quatrefoils and other conventional forms filled with foliage and
shields.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTUE<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (from Fr. <i>battre</i>, to beat), the beating of game from

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BATTUS,<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> the legendary founder of the Greek colony of Cyrene
in Libya (about 630 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). The Greeks who accompanied him
were, like himself, natives of Thera, and descended partly from
the race of the Minyae. Various accounts are given both of the
founding of Cyrene and of the origin of the founder&rsquo;s name.
According to the Cyrenaeans (Herod, iv. 150-156), Battus,
having an impediment in his speech, consulted the oracle at
Delphi, and was told to found a colony in Libya; according to
the Theraeans, Battus was entrusted with this mission by their
aged king Grinus. In another version, there was civil war in
Thera; Battus, leader of one party, was banished, and, on
applying to the oracle, was recommended to take out a colony to
&ldquo;the continent&rdquo; (Schol. Pindar, <i>Pyth.</i> iv. 10). In any case
the foundation is attributed to the direct instructions of
Apollo. The name was connected by some with <span class="grk" title="battarizo">&#946;&#945;&#964;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#969;</span>,
(&ldquo;stammer&rdquo;), but Herodotus (iv. 155) says that it was the
Libyan word for &ldquo;king,&rdquo; that Battus was not called by the name
until after his arrival at Libya, and that the oracle addressed
him as &ldquo;Battus&rdquo; by anticipation. This, however, would imply
on the part of the oracle a knowledge of Libya, which was not
shared by the rest of Greece (Herod. <i>l.c</i>.), and it is noteworthy
that the name occurs in Arcadian and Messenian legends.
Herodotus does not know his real name, but Pindar (<i>Pyth.</i> v. 116),
no doubt rightly, calls the founder of the colony Aristoteles,
while Justin (xiii. 7) gives his name as Aristaeus who was
worshipped at Cyrene. Four kings named Battus, alternating
with four named Arcesilaus, ruled in Cyrene (<i>q.v</i>.) till the fall of
the dynasty about 450 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

shore of the Black Sea, in 41° 39&prime; N. and 41° 38&prime; E. Pop. (1875)
2000; (1900) 28,512, very mixed. The bay is being filled up by
the sand carried into it by several small rivers. The town is
protected by strong forts, and the anchorage has been greatly
improved by artificial works. Batum possesses a cathedral,
finished in 1903, and the Alexander Park, with sub-tropical
vegetation. The climate is very warm, lemon and orange trees,
magnolias and palms growing in the open air; but it is at the
same time extremely wet and changeable. The annual rainfall
(90 in.) is higher than anywhere in Caucasia, but it is very
unequally distributed (23 in. in August and September, sometimes
16 in. in a couple of days), and the place is still most unhealthy.
The town is connected by rail with the main Transcaucasian
railway to Tiflis, and is the chief port for the export of naphtha
and paraffin oil, carried hither in great part through pipes
laid down from Baku, but partly also in tank railway-cars;
other exports are wheat, manganese, wool, silkworm-cocoons,
liquorice, maize and timber (total value of exports nearly 5½
millions sterling annually). The imports, chiefly tin plates and
machinery, amount to less than half that total. Known as
Bathys in antiquity, as Vati in the middle ages, and as Bathumi
since the beginning of the 17th century, Batum belonged to the
Turks, who strongly fortified it, down to 1878, when it was
transferred to Russia. In the winter of 1905-1906 Batum was
in the hands of the revolutionists, and a &ldquo;reign of terror&rdquo;
lasted for several weeks.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BATWA,<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> a tribe of African pygmies living in the mountainous
country around Wissmann Falls in the Kasai district of the
Belgian Congo. They were discovered in 1880 by Paul Pogge
and Hermann von Wissmann, and have been identified with Sir
H.M. Stanley&rsquo;s Vouatouas. They are typical of the negrito
family south of the Congo. They are well made, with limbs
perfectly proportioned, and are seldom more than 4 ft. high.
Their complexion is a yellow-brown, much lighter than their
Bantu-Negroid neighbours. They have short woolly hair and
no beard. They are feared rather than despised by the Baluba
and Bakuba tribes, among whom they live. They are nomads,
cultivating nothing, and keeping no animals but a small type of
hunting-dog. Their weapon is a tiny bow, the arrows for which
are usually poisoned. They build themselves temporary huts
of a bee-hive shape. As hunters they are famous, bounding
through the jungle growth &ldquo;like grasshoppers&rdquo; and fearlessly
attacking elephants and buffalo with their tiny weapons. Their
only occupation apart from hunting is the preparation of palm-wine
which they barter for grain with the Baluba. They are
monogamous and display much family affection. See further

<p><span class="bold">BATYPHONE<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (Ger. and Fr. <i>Batyphon</i>), a contrabass clarinet
which was the outcome of F.W. Wieprecht&rsquo;s endeavour to
obtain a contrabass for the reed instruments. The batyphone
was made to a scale twice the size of the clarinet in C, the divisions
of the chromatic scale being arranged according to acoustic
principles. For convenience in stopping holes too far apart to
be covered by the fingers, crank or swivel keys were used. The
instrument was constructed of maple-wood, had a clarinet
mouthpiece of suitable size connected by means of a cylindrical
brass crook with the upper part of the tube, and a brass bell.
The pitch was two octaves below the clarinet in C, the compass
being the same, and thus corresponding to the modern bass tuba.
The tone was pleasant and full, but not powerful enough for the
contrabass register in a military band. The batyphone had
besides one serious disadvantage: it could be played with facility
only in its nearly related keys, G and F major. The batyphone
was invented and patented in 1839 by F.W. Wieprecht,
director general of all the Prussian military bands, and E. Skorra,
the court instrument manufacturer of Berlin. In practice the
instrument was found to be of little use, and was superseded by
the bass tuba. A similar attempt was made in 1843 by Adolphe
Sax, and met with a similar fate.</p>

<p>A batyphone bearing the name of its inventors formed part of
the Snoeck collection which was acquired for Berlin&rsquo;s collection
of ancient musical instruments at the Technische Hochschule
für Musik. The description of the batyphone given above
is mainly derived from a MS. treatise on instrumentation by
Wieprecht, in 1909 in the possession of Herr Otto Lessmann
(Berlin), and reproduced by Capt. C.R. Day, in <i>Descriptive
Catalogue of the Musical Instruments of the Royal Military
Exhibition, London, 1890</i> (London, 1891), p. 124.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAUCHI,<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> a province in the highlands of the British protectorate
of Northern Nigeria. It lies approximately between
11° 15&prime; and 9° 15&prime; N. and 11° 15&prime; and 8° 30&prime; E. Bauchi is bounded
N. by the provinces of Kano, Katagum and Bornu; E. by
Bornu, S. by Yola and Muri, and W. by the provinces of Zaria
and Nassarawa. The province has an area of about 21,000 sq. m.
The altitude rises from 1000 ft. above the sea in its north-eastern
corner to 4000 ft. and 6000 ft. in the south-west. The province
is traversed diagonally from N.E. to S.W. by a belt of mountain
ranges alternating with fertile plateaus. Towards the south the
country is very rugged and a series of extinct volcanic craters
occur.</p>

<p>Amongst the more important plateaus are the Assab or
Kibyen country, having a general level of upwards of 4000 ft.,
and the Sura country, also reaching to elevations of from 3000
to 5000 ft. Both these extensive plateaus are situated in the
south-west portion of the province. Their soil is fertile, they
possess an abundance of pure water, the air is keen and bracing,
and the climate is described as resembling in many respects that
of the Transvaal. They form the principal watershed not only
of the province of Bauchi, but of the protectorate of Northern
Nigeria. The Gongola, flowing east and south to the Benue,
rises in the Sura district, and from the Kibyen plateau streams
flow north to Lake Chad, west to the Kaduna, and south to the
Benue. The soil is generally fertile between the hills, and in the
volcanic districts the slopes are cultivated half-way up the
extinct craters. The climate in the western parts is temperate
and healthy. In the winter months of November and December
the thermometer frequently falls to freezing-point, and in the
hottest months the maximum on the Kibyen plateau has been
found to be rarely over 85°.</p>

<p>The population of Bauchi is estimated at about 1,000,000 and
is of a very various description. The upper classes are Fula, and
there are some Hausa and Kanuri (Bornuese), but the bulk of
the people are pagan tribes in a very low state of civilization.
Sixty-four tribes sufficiently differentiated from each other to
speak different languages have been reported upon. Hausa is
the <i>lingua franca</i> of the whole. The pagan population has been
classified for practical purposes as Hill pagans and Plains pagans,
Mounted pagans and Foot pagans. The Foot pagans of the
plains were brought under the Fula yoke in the beginning of
the 19th century and have never cast it off. The Hill pagans
were partly conquered, but many remained independent or have
since succeeded in asserting their freedom. The Mounted pagans
are confined to the healthy plateaus of the south-west corner of
the province. They are independent and there is considerable
variety in the characteristics of the different tribes. The better
types are hardy, orderly and agriculturally industrious. They
are intelligent and have shown themselves peaceful and friendly
to Europeans. Others are, on the contrary, disposed to be
turbulent and warlike. Amongst the different tribes many are
cannibals. They all go practically naked. They are essentially
horsemen, and have a cruel habit of gashing the backs of their
ponies that they may get a good seat in the blood. They are
armed with bows and arrows, but depend almost entirely in
battle on the charges of their mounted spearmen.</p>

<p>The native name &ldquo;Bauchi,&rdquo; which is of great antiquity,
Signifies the &ldquo;Land of Slaves,&rdquo; and from the earliest times the
uplands which now form the principal portion of the province
been the hunting ground of the slave raider, while the hill
fastnesses have offered defensible refuge to the population. So
entirely was slavery a habit of the people, that as late as 1905,
after the slave-trade had been abolished for three years, it was
found that, in consequence of a famine which rendered food
difficult to obtain, a whole tribe (the Tangali) were selling
themselves as slaves to their neighbours. Children are readily
sold by their parents at a price varying from the equivalent of
one shilling to one and sixpence.</p>

<p>The province of Bauchi was conquered by the Fula at the
beginning of the 19th century, and furnished them with a valuable
slave preserve. But the more civilized portion had already,
under enlightened native rulers, attained to a certain degree of
prosperity and order. Mahommedanism was partly adopted by
the upper classes in the 18th century, if not earlier, and the son
of a Mahommedan native ruler, educated at Sokoto, accepted
the flag of Dan Fodio and conquered the country for the Fula.
The name of this remarkable soldier and leader was Yakoba
(Jacob). His father&rsquo;s name was Daouad (David), and his grandfather
was Abdullah, all names which indicate Arab or Mahommedan
influence. The town of Bauchi and capital of the province
was founded by Yakoba in the year 1809, and the emirate
remained under Fula rule until the year 1902. In that year,
in consequence of determined slave-raiding and the defiant
misrule of the emir, a British expedition was sent against the
capital, which submitted without fighting. The emir was deposed,
and the country was brought under British control. A new emir
was appointed, but he died within a few months. The slave-trade
was immediately abolished, and the slave-market which was held
at Bauchi, as in all Fula centres, was closed. The Kano-Sokoto
campaign in 1903 rendered necessary a temporary withdrawal of
the British resident from Bauchi, and comparatively little progress
was made until the following year. In 1904 the province
was organized for administration on the same system as the rest
of Northern Nigeria, and the reigning emir took the oath of
allegiance to the British crown. The province has been subdivided
into thirteen administrative districts, which again have
been grouped into their principal divisions, with their respective
British headquarters at Bauchi, Kanan and Bukuru. The Fula
portion of this province, held like the other Hausa states under
a feudal system of large landowners or fief-holders, has been
organized and assessed for taxation on the system accepted by
the emirs throughout the protectorate, and the populations are
working harmoniously under British rule. Roads and telegraphs
are in process of construction, and the province is being gradually
opened to trade. Valuable indications of tin have been found to
the north of the Kibyen plateau, and have attracted the attention
of the Niger Company.</p>

<p>Bauchi is a province of special importance from the European
point of view because, with free communication from the Benue
assured, it is probable that on the Kibyen and Sura plateaus,
which are the healthiest known in the protectorate, a sanatorium
and station for a large civil population might be established under
conditions in which Europeans could live free from the evil
effects of a West African climate.</p>

<p>The emirate of Gombe, which is included in the first division
of the Bauchi province, is a Fula emirate independent of the
emirs of Bauchi. It forms a rich and important district, and its
chiefs held themselves in a somewhat sullen attitude of hostility
to the British. It was at Burmi in this district that the last
stand was made by the religious following of the defeated sultan
of Sokoto, and here the sultan was finally overthrown and killed
in July 1903. Gombe has now frankly accepted British rule.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUDELAIRE, CHARLES PIERRE<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (1821-1867), French poet,
was born in Paris on the 9th of April 1821. His father, who was
a civil servant in good position and an amateur artist, died in
1827, and in the following year his mother married a lieutenant-colonel
named Aupick, who was afterwards ambassador of France
at various courts. Baudelaire was educated at Lyons and at the
Collège Louis-le Grand in Paris. On taking his degree in 1839
he determined to enter on a literary career, and during the next
two years pursued a very irregular way of life, which led his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page537" id="page537"></a>537</span>
guardians, in 1841, to send him on a voyage to India. When he
returned to Paris, after less than a year&rsquo;s absence, he was of age;
but in a year or two his extravagance threatened to exhaust his
small patrimony, and his family obtained a decree to place his
property in trust. His <i>salons</i> of 1845 and 1846 attracted
immediate attention by the boldness with which he propounded
many views then novel, but since generally accepted. He took
part with the revolutionaries in 1848, and for some years interested
himself in republican politics but his permanent convictions
were aristocratic and Catholic. Baudelaire was a slow
and fastidious worker, and it was not until 1857 that he produced
his first and famous volume of poems, <i>Fleurs du mal</i>. Some of
these had already appeared in the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i> when
they were published by Baudelaire&rsquo;s friend Auguste Poulet
Malassis, who had inherited a printing business at Alençon. The
consummate art displayed in these verses was appreciated by a
limited public, but general attention was caught by the perverse
selection of morbid subjects, and the book became a by-word
for unwholesomeness among conventional critics. Victor Hugo,
writing to the poet, said, &ldquo;Vous dotez le ciel de l&rsquo;art d&rsquo;un rayon
macabre, vous créez un frisson nouveau.&rdquo; Baudelaire, the
publisher, and the printer were successfully prosecuted for
offending against public morals. The obnoxious pieces were
suppressed, but printed later as <i>Les Épaves</i> (Brussels, 1866).
Another edition of the <i>Fleurs du mal</i>, without these poems, but
with considerable additions, appeared in 1861.</p>

<p>Baudelaire had learnt English in his childhood, and had found
some of his favourite reading in the English &ldquo;Satanic&rdquo; romances,
such as Lewis&rsquo;s <i>Monk</i>. In 1846-1847 he became acquainted
with the works of Edgar Allan Poe, in which he discovered
romances and poems which had, he said, long existed in his own
brain, but had never taken shape. From this time till 1865 he
was largely occupied with his version of Poe&rsquo;s works, producing
masterpieces of the art of translation in <i>Histoires extraordinaires</i>
(1852), <i>Nouvelles Histoires extraordinaires</i> (1857), <i>Adventures
d&rsquo;Arthur Gordon Pym, Eureka</i>, and <i>Histoires grotesques et sérieuses</i>
(1865). Two essays on Poe are to be found in his <i>&OElig;uvres
complètes</i> (vols. v. and vi.). Meanwhile his financial difficulties
grew upon him. He was involved in the failure of Poulet
Malassis in 1861, and in 1864 he left Paris for Belgium, partly in
the vain hope of disposing of his copyrights. He had for many
years a <i>liaison</i> with a coloured woman, whom he helped to the
end of his life in spite of her gross conduct. He had recourse to
opium, and in Brussels he began to drink to excess. Paralysis
followed, and the last two years of his life were spent in <i>maisons
de santé</i> in Brussels and in Paris, where he died on the 31st of
August 1867.</p>

<p>His other works include:&mdash;<i>Petits Poèmes en prose</i>; a series of
art criticisms published in the <i>Pays, Exposition universelle</i>;
studies on Gustave Flaubert (in <i>L&rsquo;artiste</i>, 18th of October 1857);
on Théophile Gautier (<i>Revue contemporaine</i>, September 1858);
valuable notices contributed to Eugène Crépet&rsquo;s <i>Poètes français</i>;
<i>Les Paradis artificiels opium et haschisch</i> (1860); <i>Richard Wagner
et Tannhäuser à Paris</i> (1861); <i>Un Dernier Chapitre de l&rsquo;histoire des
&oelig;uvres de Balzac</i> (1880), originally an article entitled &ldquo;Comment
on paye ses dettes quand on a du génie,&rdquo; in which his criticism
is turned against his friends H. de Balzac, Théophile Gautier,
and Gérard de Nerval.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;An edition of his <i>Lettres</i> (1841-1866) was issued
by the Soc. du Mercure de France in 1906. His <i>&OElig;uvres complètes</i>
were edited (1868-1870) by his friend Charles Asselineau, with a
preface by Théophile Gautier. Asselineau also undertook a vindication
of his character from the attacks made upon it in his <i>Charles
Baudelaire, sa vie, son &oelig;uvre</i> (1869). He left some material of more
private interest in a MS. entitled <i>Baudelaire</i>. See <i>Charles Baudelaire,
souvenirs, correspondance, bibliographie</i> (1872), by Charles Cousin
and Spoelberch de Lovenjoul; <i>Charles Baudelaire, &oelig;uvres posthumes

<i>Mon c&oelig;ur mis à nu</i>, and a biographical study by Eugène Crépet;
also <i>Le Tombeau de Charles Baudelaire</i> (1896), a collection of pieces
unpublished or prohibited during the author&rsquo;s lifetime, edited by
S. Mallarmé and others, with a study of the text of the <i>Fleurs du
mal</i> by Prince A. Ourousof; Féli Gautier, <i>Charles Baudelaire</i> (Brussels,
1904), with facsimiles of drawings by Baudelaire himself; A. de la

<i>Les Artistes littéraires</i> (1889). Among English translations from
Baudelaire are <i>Poems in Prose</i>, by A. Symons (1905), and a selection
for the <i>Canterbury Poets</i> (1904), by F.P. Sturm.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUDIER, MICHEL<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1589-1645), French historian, was
born in Languedoc. During the reign of Louis XIII. he was
historiographer to the Court of France. He contributed to
French history by writing <i>Histoire de la guerre de Flandre 1559-1609</i>
(Paris, 1615); <i>Histoire de l&rsquo;administration du cardinal
d&rsquo;Amboise, grand ministre d&rsquo;état en France</i> (Paris, 1634), a
defence of the cardinal; and <i>Histoire de l&rsquo;administration de
l&rsquo;abbé Suger</i> (Paris, 1645). Taking an especial interest in the
Turks he wrote <i>Inventaire général de l&rsquo;histoire des Turcs</i> (Paris,
1619); <i>Histoire générale de la religion des Turcs avec la vie de
leur prophète Mahomet</i> (Paris, 1626); and <i>Histoire générale du
sérail et de la cour du grand Turc</i> (Paris, 1626; English trans. by
E. Grimeston, London, 1635). Having heard the narrative of
a Jesuit who had returned from China, Baudier wrote <i>Histoire
de la cour du roi de Chine</i> (Paris, 1626; English trans. in vol. viii.
of the <i>Collection of Voyages and Travels</i> of A. and J. Churchill,
London, 1707-1747). He also wrote <i>Vie du cardinal Ximénès</i>
(Paris, 1635), which was again published with a notice of the
author by E. Baudier (Paris, 1851), and a curious romance
entitled <i>Histoire de l&rsquo;incomparable administration de Romieu, grand

<p><span class="bold">BAUDRILLART, HENRI JOSEPH LÉON<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (1821-1892), French
economist, was born in Paris on the 28th of November 1821.
His father, Jacques Joseph (1774-1832), was a distinguished
writer on forestry, and was for many years in the service of the
French government, eventually becoming the head of that
branch of the department of agriculture which had charge of the
state forests. Henri was educated at the Collège Bourbon,
where he had a distinguished career, and in 1852 he was appointed
assistant lecturer in political economy to M. Chevalier at the
Collège de France. In 1866, on the creation of a new chair of
economic history, Baudrillart was appointed to fill it. His first
work was an <i>Éloge de Turgot</i> (1846), which at once
won him notice among the economists. In 1853 he published an
erudite work on <i>Jean Bodin et son temps</i>; then in 1857 a <i>Manuel
d&rsquo;économie politique</i>; in 1860, <i>Des rapports de la morale et
de l&rsquo;économie politique</i>; in 1865, <i>La Liberté du travail</i>; and from
1878 to 1880, <i>L&rsquo;Histoire du luxe ... depuis l&rsquo;antiquité jusqu&rsquo;à
nos jours</i>, in four volumes. At the instance of the Académie des
Sciences Morales et Politiques he investigated the condition of
the farming classes of France, and published the results in four
volumes (1885, <i>et seq</i>.). From 1855 to 1864 he directed the
<i>Journal des économistes</i>, and contributed many articles to the
<i>Journal des débats</i> and to the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>. His
writings are distinguished by their style, as well as by their
profound erudition. In 1863 he was elected member of the Académie
des Sciences Morales et Politiques; in 1870 he was
appointed inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1881 he
succeeded J. Garnier as professor of political economy at the
École des Ponts et Chaussées. Baudrillart was made an officer
of the Legion of Honour in 1889. He died in Paris on the 24th of
January 1892.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUDRY,<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Balderich</span>, <b>OF BOURGUEIL</b> (1046 or 1047-1130),
archbishop of Dol, historian and poet, was born at Meung-sur-Loire,
where he passed his early days. Educated at Meung
and at Angers, he entered the Benedictine abbey of Bourgueil,
and in 1079 became abbot of this place, but his time was devoted
to literary pursuits rather than to his official duties. Having
failed to secure the bishopric of Orleans in 1097, he became
archbishop of Dol in 1107, and went to Rome for his pallium in
1108. The bishopric of Dol had been raised to the rank of an
archbishopric during the 10th century by Nomenoé, king of
Brittany, but this step had been objected to by the archbishops
of Tours. Consequently the position of the see was somewhat
ambiguous, and Baudry is referred to both as archbishop and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page538" id="page538"></a>538</span>
bishop of Dol. He appears to have striven earnestly to do
something for the education of the ignorant inhabitants of
Brittany but his efforts were not very successful, and he soon
abandoned the task. In 1116 he attended the Lateran council,
and in 1119 the council of Reims, after which he paid a visit
of two years&rsquo; duration to England. Returning to France he
neglected the affairs of his diocese, and passed his time mainly
at St Samson-sur-Risle in Normandy. He died on the 5th or
7th of January 1130.</p>

<p>Baudry wrote a number of Latin poems of very indifferent
quality. The most important of these, from the historical point
of view, have been published in the <i>Historiae Francorum Scriptores</i>,
tome iv., edited by A. Duchesne (Paris 1639-1649). Baudry&rsquo;s
prose works are more important. The best known of these is his
<i>Historiae Hierosolymitance</i>, a history of the first crusade from
1095 to 1099. This is a history in four books, the material for
which was mainly drawn from the anonymous <i>Gesta Francorum</i>,
but some valuable information has been added by Baudry.
It was very popular during the middle ages, and was used by
Ordericus Vitalis for his <i>Historiae ecclesiasticae</i>; by William,
archbishop of Tyre, for his <i>Belli sacri historia</i>; and by Vincent
of Beauvais for his <i>Speculum historiale</i>. The best edition is that
by C. Thurot, which appears in the <i>Recueil des historiens des
croisades</i>, tome iv. (Paris, 1841-1887), Other works probably by
Baudry are <i>Epistola ad Fiscannenses monachos</i>, a description of
the monastery of Fécamp; <i>Vita Roberti de Arbrissello; Vita
S. Hugonis archiepiscopi Rothomagensis; Translatio capitis
Gemeticum et miracula S. Valentini martyris; Relatio de scuto
et gladio</i>, a history of the arms of St. Michael; and <i>Vita
S. Samsonis Dolensis episcopi</i>. Other writings which on very
doubtful authority have been attributed to Baudry are <i>Acta
S. Valeriani martyris Trenorchii; De visitatione infirmorum;
Vita S. Maglorii Dolensis episcopi et Vita S. Maclovii, Alectensis
episcopi; De revelatione abbatum Fiscannensium</i>; and
<i>Confirmatio bonorum monasterii S. Florentii</i>. Many of these are
published by J.P. Migne in the <i>Patrologia Latina</i>, tomes 160,
162 and 166 (Paris 1844).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUDRY, PAUL JACQUES AIMÉ<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> (1828-1886), French
painter, was born at La Roche-sur-Yonne (Vendée). He studied
under Drolling, a sound but second-rate artist, and carried off
the Prix de Rome in 1850 by his picture of &ldquo;Zenobia found on
the banks of the Araxes.&rdquo; His talent from the first revealed
itself as strictly academical, full of elegance and grace, but
somewhat lacking originality. In the course of his residence in
Italy Baudry derived strong inspiration from Italian art with
the mannerism of Coreggio, as was very evident in the two works
he exhibited in the Salon of 1857, which were purchased for
the Luxembourg: &ldquo;The Martyrdom of a Vestal Virgin&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Child.&rdquo; His &ldquo;Leda,&rdquo; &ldquo;St John the Baptist,&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;Portrait of Beulé,&rdquo; exhibited at the same time, took a first
prize that year. Throughout this early period Baudry commonly
selected mythological or fanciful subjects, one of the most
noteworthy being &ldquo;The Pearl and the Wave.&rdquo; Once only did
he attempt an historical picture, &ldquo;Charlotte Corday after the
murder of Marat&rdquo; (1861), and returned by preference to the
former class of subjects or to painting portraits of illustrious men
of his day&mdash;Guizot, Charles Garnier, Edmond About. The
works that crowned Baudry&rsquo;s reputation were his mural decorations,
which show much imagination and a high artistic gift for
colour, as may be seen in the frescoes in the Paris Cour de
Cassation, at the château of Chantilly, and some private residences&mdash;the
hôtel Fould and hôtel Paiva&mdash;but, above all, in the
decorations of the <i>foyer</i> of the Paris opera house. These, more
than thirty paintings in all, and among them compositions
figurative of dancing and music, occupied the painter, for ten
years. Baudry died in Paris in 1886. He was a member of the
Institut de France, succeeding Jean Victor Schnetz. Two of
his colleagues, Dubois and Marius Jean Mercie, co-operating
with his brother, Baudry the architect, erected a monument to
him in Paris (1890). The statue of Baudry at La Roche-sur-Yonne
(1897) is by Gérôme.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUER, BRUNO<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> (1809-1882), German theologian and historian,
was born on the 6th of September 1809, the son of a painter in a
porcelain factory, at Eisenberg in Saxe-Altenburg. He studied
at Berlin, where he attached himself to the &ldquo;Right&rdquo; of the
Hegelian school under P. Marheineke. In 1834 he began to teach
in Berlin as a licentiate of theology, and in 1839 was transferred
to Bonn. In 1838 he published his <i>Kritische Darstellung der
Religion des Alten Testaments</i> (2 vols.), which shows that at that
date he was still faithful to the Hegelian Right. Soon afterwards
his opinions underwent a change, and in two works, one on the
Fourth Gospel, <i>Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte des Johannes</i>
(1840), and the other on the Synoptics, <i>Kritik der evangelischen
Geschichte der Synoptiker</i> (1841), as well as in his <i>Herr Hengstenberg,
kritische Briefe über den Gegensatz des Gesetzes und des
Evangeliums</i>, he announced his complete rejection of his earlier
orthodoxy. In 1842 the government revoked his license and he
retired for the rest of his life to Rixdorf, near Berlin. Henceforward
he took a deep interest in modern history and politics, as
well as in theology, and published <i>Geschichte der Politik, Kultur
und Aufklärung des 18ten Jahrhunderts</i> (4 vols. 1843-1845),
Geschichte der französischen Revolution (3 vols. 1847), and
<i>Disraelis romantischer und Bismarcks socialistischer Imperialismus</i>
(1882). Other critical works are: a criticism of the gospels and a
history of their origin, <i>Kritik der Evangelien und Geschichte ihres
Ursprungs</i> (1850-1852), a book on the Acts of the Apostles,
<i>Apostelgeschichte</i> (1850), and a criticism of the Pauline epistles,
<i>Kritik der paulinischen Briefe</i> (1850-1852). He died at Rixdorf
on the 13th of April 1882. His criticism of the New Testament
was of a highly destructive type. David Strauss in his <i>Life of
Jesus</i> had accounted for the Gospel narratives as half-conscious
products of the mythic instinct in the early Christian communities.
Bauer ridiculed Strauss&rsquo;s notion that a community
could produce a connected narrative. His own contention,
embodying a theory of C.G. Wilke (<i>Der Urevangelist</i>, 1838), was
that the original narrative was the Gospel of Mark; that this was
composed in the reign of Hadrian; and that after this the other
narratives were modelled by other writers. He, however,
&ldquo;regarded Mark not only as the first narrator, but even as the
creator of the gospel history, thus making the latter a fiction
and Christianity the invention of a single original evangelist&rdquo;
(Pfleiderer). On the same principle the four principal Pauline
epistles were regarded as forgeries of the 2nd century. He argued
further for the preponderance of the Graeco-Roman element, as
opposed to the Jewish, in the Christian writings. The writer of
Mark&rsquo;s gospel was &ldquo;an Italian, at home both in Rome and
Alexandria&rdquo;; that of Matthew&rsquo;s gospel &ldquo;a Roman, nourished
by the spirit of Seneca&rdquo;; the Pauline epistles were written in
the West in antagonism to the Paul of the Acts, and so on.
Christianity is essentially &ldquo;Stoicism triumphant in a Jewish
garb.&rdquo; This line of criticism has found few supporters, mostly
in the Netherlands. It certainly had its value in emphasizing the
importance of studying the influence of environment in the
formation of the Christian Scriptures. Bauer was a man of restless,
impetuous activity and independent, if ill-balanced, judgment,
one who, as he himself perceived, was more in place as a
free-lance of criticism than as an official teacher. He came in the
end to be regarded kindly even by opponents, and he was not
afraid of taking a line displeasing to his liberal friends on the
Jewish question (<i>Die Judenfrage</i>, 1843).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUERNFELD, EDUARD VON<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> (1802-1890), Austrian dramatist,
was born at Vienna on the 13th of January 1802. Having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page539" id="page539"></a>539</span>
studied jurisprudence at the university of Vienna, he entered the
government service in a legal capacity, and after holding various
minor offices was transferred in 1843 to a responsible post on the
Lottery Commission. He had already embarked upon politics,
and severely criticized the government in a pamphlet, <i>Pia
Desideria eines österreichischen Schriftstellers</i> (1842); and in
1845 he made a journey to England, after which his political opinions
became more pronounced. After the Revolution, in 1848, he
quitted the government service in order to devote himself entirely
to letters. He lived in Vienna until his death on the 9th of August
1890, and was ennobled for his work. As a writer of comedies
and farces, Bauernfeld takes high rank among the German
playwrights of the century; his plots are clever, the situations
witty and natural and the diction elegant. His earliest essays,
the comedies <i>Leichtsinn aus Liebe</i> (1831); <i>Das
Liebes-Protokoll</i> (1831) and <i>Die ewige Liebe</i> (1834);
<i>Bürgerlich und Romantisch</i>, (1835) enjoyed great popularity.
Later he turned his attention to so-called <i>Salonstücke</i>
(drawing-room pieces), notably <i>Aus der Gesellschaft</i> (1866);
<i>Moderne Jugend</i> (1869), and <i>Der Landfrieden</i> (1869),
in which he portrays in fresh, bright and happy sallies the
social conditions of the capital in which he lived.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUHIN, GASPARD<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (1560-1624), Swiss botanist and anatomist,
was the son of a French physician, Jean Bauhin (1511-1582),
who had to leave his native country on becoming a
convert to Protestantism. He was born at Basel on the 17th of
January 1560, and devoting himself to medicine, he pursued his
studies at Padua, Montpellier, and some of the celebrated schools
in Germany. Returning to Basel in 1580, he was admitted to
the degree of doctor, and gave private lectures in botany and
anatomy. In 1582 he was appointed to the Greek professorship
in that university, and in 1588 to the chair of anatomy and
botany. He was afterwards made city physician, professor of
the practice of medicine, rector of the university, and dean of
his faculty. He died at Basel on the 5th of December 1624. He
published several works relative to botany, of which the most
valuable was his <i>Pinax Theatri Botanici, seu Index in
Theophrasti, Dioscoridis, Plinii, et botanicorum qui a seculo
scripserunt opera</i> (1596). Another great work which he planned was
a <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i>, meant to be comprised in twelve parts
folio, of which he finished three; only one, however, was published
(1658). He also gave a copious catalogue of the plants
growing in the environs of Basel, and edited the works of P.A.
Mattioli (1500-1577) with considerable additions. He likewise
wrote on anatomy, his principal work on this subject being
<i>Theatrum Anatomicum infinitis locis auctum</i> (1592).</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Jean Gaspard Bauhin</span> (1606-1685), was professor
of botany at Basel for thirty years. His elder brother, <span class="sc">Jean
Bauhin</span> (1541-1613), after studying botany at Tübingen under
Leonard Fuchs (1501-1566), and travelling with Conrad Gesner,
began to practise medicine at Basel, where he was elected professor
of rhetoric in 1766. Four years later he was invited to
become physician to the duke of Württemberg at Montbéliard,
where he remained till his death in 1613. He devoted himself
chiefly to botany. His great work, <i>Historia plantarum nova et
absolutissima</i>, a compilation of all that was then known about
botany, was not complete at his death, but was published at
Yverdon in 1650-1651, the <i>Prodromus</i> having appeared at the same
place in 1619. He also wrote a book <i>De aquis medicatis</i> (1605).</p>

agriculture. From the meaning of something left untouched
comes that of a hindrance or check, so of a horse stopping short
of an obstacle, of the &ldquo;baulk-line&rdquo; in billiards, or of the deceptive

<p><span class="bold">BAUMBACH, RUDOLF<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (1840-1905), German poet, was born
at Kranichfeld on the Ilm in Thuringia, on the 28th of September
1840, the son of a local medical practitioner, and received his
early schooling at the gymnasium of Meiningen, to which place
his father had removed. After studying natural science in
various universities, he engaged in private tuition, both
independently and in families, in the Austrian towns of Graz, Brünn,
Görz and Triest respectively. In Triest he caught the popular
taste with an Alpine legend, <i>Zlatorog</i> (1877), and songs of a
journeyman apprentice, <i>Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen</i> (1878),
both of which have run into many editions. Their success
decided him to embark upon a literary career. In 1885 he
returned to Meiningen, where he received the title of <i>Hofrat</i>,
and was appointed ducal librarian. His death occurred on the
14th of September 1905.</p>

<p>Baumbach was a poet of the breezy, vagabond school, and
wrote, in imitation of his greater compatriot, Victor Scheffel,
many excellent drinking songs, among which <i>Die Lindenwirtin</i>
has endeared him to the German student world. But his real
strength lay in narrative verse, especially when he had the
opportunity of describing the scenery and life of his native Thuringia.
Special mention may be made of <i>Frau Holde</i> (1881),
<i>Spielmannslieder</i> (1882), <i>Von der Landstrasse</i> (1882),
<i>Thüringer Lieder</i> (1891), and his prose, <i>Sommermärchen</i> (1881).</p>

Senlis on the 26th of February 1728. He was apprenticed to
the chemist Claude Joseph Geoffroy, and in 1752 was admitted
a member of the École de Pharmacie, where in the same year he
was appointed professor of chemistry. The money he made in a
business he carried on in Paris for dealing in chemical products
enabled him to retire in 1780 in order to devote himself to
applied chemistry, but, ruined in the Revolution, he was obliged
to return to a commercial career. He devised many improvements
in technical processes, <i>e.g.</i> for bleaching silk, dyeing,
gilding, purifying saltpetre, &amp;c., but he is best known as the
inventor of the hydrometer associated with his name (often in
this connexion improperly spelt Beaumé). Of the numerous
books and papers he wrote the most important is his <i>Élémens de
pharmacie théorique et pratique</i> (9 editions, 1762-1818). He
became a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1772, and an
associate of the Institute in 1796. He died in Paris on the 15th
of October 1804.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUMGARTEN, ALEXANDER GOTTLIEB<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (1714-1762),
German philosopher, born at Berlin. He studied at Halle, and
became professor of philosophy at Halle and at Frankfort on the
Oder, where he died in 1762. He was a disciple of Leibnitz and
Wolff, and was particularly distinguished as having been the
first to establish the <i>Theory of the Beautiful</i> as an independent
science. Baumgarten did good service in severing aesthetics
(<i>q.v.</i>) from the other philosophic disciplines, and in marking out
a definite object for its researches. The very name (<i>Aesthetics</i>),
which Baumgarten was the first to use, indicates the imperfect
and partial nature of his analysis, pointing as it does to an element
so variable as <i>feeling</i> or <i>sensation</i> as the ultimate ground of
judgment in questions pertaining to beauty. It is important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page540" id="page540"></a>540</span>
to notice that Baumgarten&rsquo;s first work preceded those of Burke,
Diderot, and P. André, and that Kant had a great admiration
for him. The principal works of Baumgarten are the following:
<i>Dispulationes de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus</i> (1735);
<i>Aesthetics; Metaphysica</i> (1739; 7th ed. 1779); <i>Ethica philosophica</i>
(1751, 2nd ed. 1763); <i>Initia philosophiae practicae
primae</i> (1760). After his death, his pupils published a <i>Philosophia
Generalis</i> (1770) and a <i>Jus Naturae</i> (1765), which he had
left in manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUMGARTEN, MICHAEL<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> (1812-1889), German Protestant
theologian, was born at Haseldorf in Schleswig-Holstein on the
25th of March 1812. He studied at Kiel University (1832), and
became professor ordinarius of theology at Rostock (1850). A
liberal scholar, he became widely known in 1854 through a work,
<i>Die Nachtgesichte Sacharjas. Eine Prophetenstimme aus der
Gegenwart</i>, in which, starting from texts in the Old Testament
and assuming the tone of a prophet, he discussed topics of every
kind. At a pastoral conference in 1856 he boldly defended
evangelical freedom as regards the legal sanctity of Sunday.
This, with other attempts to liberalize religion, brought him into
conflict with the ecclesiastical authorities of Mecklenburg, and in
1858 he was deprived of his professorship. He then travelled
throughout Germany, demanding justice, telling the story of his
life (<i>Christliche Selbstgespräche</i>, 1861), and lecturing on the life
of Jesus (<i>Die Geschichte Jesu. Für das Verständniss der Gegenwart</i>,
1859). In 1865 he helped to found the <i>Deutsche Protestantenverein</i>,
but withdrew from it in 1877. On several occasions

and philology. After acting as <i>Privatdocent</i> at Leipzig, he was,
in 1812, appointed professor extraordinarius of theology at Jena,
where he remained to the end of his life, rising gradually to the
head of the theological faculty. He died on the 31st of May
1842. With the exception of Church history, he lectured on all
branches of so-called theoretical theology, especially on New
Testament exegesis, biblical theology, dogmatic ethics, and the
history of dogma, and his comprehensive knowledge, accurate
scholarship and wide sympathies gave peculiar value to his
lectures and treatises, especially those on the development of
church doctrine. His published works are many, the most
important being:&mdash;<i>Lehrbuch der christtichen Sittenlehre</i> (1826);
<i>Grundzuge der biblischen Theologie</i> (1828); <i>Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte</i>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAUR, FERDINAND CHRISTIAN<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (1792-1860), leader of the
Tübingen school of theology, was born at Schmiden, near
Canstatt, on the 21st of June 1792. After receiving an early
training in the theological seminary at Blaubeuren, he went in
1809 to the university of Tübingen. Here he studied for a time
under Ernst Bengel, grandson of the eminent New Testament
critic, Johann Albrecht Bengel, and at this early stage in his
career he seems to have been under the influence of the old
Tübingen school. But at the same time the philosophers
Immanuel Fichte and Friedrich Schelling were creating a wide
and deep impression. In 1817 Baur returned to the theological
seminary at Blaubeuren as professor. This move marked a
turning-point in his life, for he was now able to set to work upon
those investigations on which his reputation rests. He had
already, in 1817, written a review of G. Kaiser&rsquo;s <i>Biblische
Theologie</i> for Bengel&rsquo;s <i>Archiv für Theologie</i> (ii. 656); its tone
was moderate and conservative. When, a few years after his
appointment at Blaubeuren, he published his first important,
work, <i>Symbolik und Mythologie oder die Naturreligion des Altertums</i>
(1824-1825), it became evident that he had made a deeper
study of philosophy, and had come under the influence of
Schelling and more particularly of Friedrich Schleiermacher.
The learning of the work was fully recognized, and in 1826 the
author was called to Tübingen as professor of theology. It is
with Tübingen that his greatest literary achievements are
associated. His earlier publications here treated of mythology
and the history of dogma. <i>Das manichäische Religionssystem</i>
appeared in 1831, <i>Apollonius von Tyana</i> in 1832, <i>Die christliche
Gnosis</i> in 1835, and <i>Über das Christliche im Platonismus oder
Socrates und Christus</i> in 1837. As Otto Pfleiderer (<i>Development
of Theology</i>, p. 285) observes, &ldquo;the choice not less than the treatment
of these subjects is indicative of the large breadth of view
and the insight of the historian into the comparative history of
religion.&rdquo; Meantime Baur had exchanged one master in philosophy
for another, Schleiermacher for Hegel. In doing so, he
had adopted completely the Hegelian philosophy of history.
&ldquo;Without philosophy,&rdquo; he has said, &ldquo;history is always for me
dead and dumb.&rdquo; The change of view is illustrated clearly in
the essay, published in the <i>Tubinger Zeitschrift</i> for 1831, on the
Christ-party in the Corinthian Church, <i>Die Chrislusparlei in
der korinthischen Gemeinde, der Gegensatz des paulinischen und
petrinischen in der älsten Kirche, der Apostel Petrus in Rom</i>,
the trend of which is suggested by the title. Baur contends that
St Paul was opposed in Corinth by a Jewish-Christian party
which wished to set up its own form of Christian religion instead
of his universal Christianity. He finds traces of a keen conflict
of parties in the post-apostolic age. The theory is further
developed in a later work (1835, the year in which David Strauss&rsquo;
<i>Leben Jesu</i> was published), <i>Über die sogenannten Pastoralbriefe</i>.
In this Baur attempts to prove that the false teachers mentioned
in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus are the Gnostics, particularly
the Marcionites, of the second century, and consequently
that the Epistles were produced in the middle of this century
in opposition to Gnosticism. He next proceeded to investigate
the Pauline Epistles and the Acts of the Apostles in the same
manner, publishing his results in 1845 under the title <i>Paulus, der
Apostel Jesu Christi, sein Leben und Wirken, seine Briefe und
seine Lehre</i>. In this he contends that only the Epistles to the
Galatians, Corinthians and Romans are genuinely Pauline, and
that the Paul of Acts is a different person from the Paul of these
genuine Epistles, the author being a Paulinist who, with an eye
to the different parties in the Church, is at pains to represent
Peter as far as possible as a Paulinist and Paul as far as possible
as a Petrinist. Thus it becomes clear that Baur is prepared to
apply his theory to the whole of the New Testament; in the
words of H.S. Nash, &ldquo;he carried a sweeping hypothesis into the
examination of the New Testament.&rdquo; Those writings alone he
considers genuine in which the conflict between Jewish-Christians
and Gentile-Christians is clearly marked. In his <i>Kritische
Untersuchungen über die kanonischen Evangelien, ihr Verhaltniss
zu einander, ihren Charakter und Ursprung</i> (1847) he turns his
attention to the Gospels, and here again finds that the authors
were conscious of the conflict of parties; the Gospels reveal
a mediating or conciliatory tendency (<i>Tendenz</i>) on the part of
the writers or redactors. The Gospels, in fact, are adaptations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page541" id="page541"></a>541</span>
or redactions of an older Gospel, such as the Gospel of the
Hebrews, of Peter, of the Egyptians, or of the Ebionites. The
Petrine Matthew bears the closest relationship to this original
Gospel (<i>Urevangelium</i>); the Pauline Luke is later and arose
independently; Mark represents a still later development;
the account in John is idealistic: it &ldquo;does not possess historical
truth, and cannot and does not really lay claim to it.&rdquo; Baur&rsquo;s
whole theory indeed starts with the supposition that Christianity
was gradually developed out of Judaism. Before it could become
a universal religion, it had to struggle with Jewish limitations and
to overcome them. The early Christians were Jewish-Christians,
to whom Jesus was the Messiah. Paul, on the other hand, represented
a breach with Judaism, the Temple, and the Law. Thus
there was some antagonism between the Jewish apostles, Peter,
James and John and the Gentile apostle Paul, and this struggle
continued down to the middle of the 2nd century. In short,
the conflict between Petrinism and Paulinism is, as Carl Schwarz
puts it, the key to the literature of the 1st and 2nd century.</p>

<p>But Baur was a theologian and historian as well as a Biblical
critic. As early as 1834 he published a strictly theological work,
<i>Gegensatz des Katholicismus und Protestantismus nach den
Prinzipien und Hauptdogmen der beiden Lehrbegriffe</i>, a strong
defence of Protestantism on the lines of Schleiermacher&rsquo;s
<i>Glaubenslehre</i>, and a vigorous reply to J. Möhler&rsquo;s <i>Symbolik</i>
(1833). This was followed by his larger histories of dogma, <i>Die
christliche Lehre van der Versöhnung in ihrer geschichtlichen
Entwicklung bis auf die neueste Zeit</i> (1838), <i>Die christliche
Lehre von der Dreieinigkeit und Menschwerdung Gottes in ihrer
geschichtlichen Entwicklung</i> (3 vols., 1841-1843), and the
<i>Lehrbuch der christlichen Dogmengeschichte</i> (1847). The value
of these works is impaired somewhat by Baur&rsquo;s habit of making
the history of dogma conform to the formulae of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy,
a procedure &ldquo;which only served to obscure the truth
and profundity of his conception of history as a true development
of the human mind&rdquo; (Pfleiderer). Baur, however, soon
came to attach more importance to personality, and to distinguish
more carefully between religion and philosophy. The change is
marked in his <i>Epochen der kirchlichen Geschichtschreibung</i> (1852),
<i>Das Christenthum und die christliche Kirche der drei ersten
Jahrhunderte</i> (1853), and <i>Die christliche Kirche von Anfang des
vierten bis zum Ende des sechsten Jahrhunderts</i> (1859), works
preparatory to his <i>Kirchengeschichte</i>, in which the change of view is
specially pronounced. The <i>Kirchengeschichte</i> was published in five
volumes during the years 1853-1863, partly by Baur himself,
partly by his son, Ferdinand Baur, and his son-in-law, Eduard
Zeller, from notes and lectures which the author left behind him.
Pfleiderer describes this work, especially the first volume, as
&ldquo;a classic for all time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Taken as a whole, it is the first
thorough and satisfactory attempt to explain the rise of Christianity
and the Church on <i>strictly historical</i> lines, <i>i.e</i>. as a natural
development of the religious spirit of our race under the combined
operation of various human causes&rdquo; (<i>Development of
Theology</i>, p. 288). Baur&rsquo;s lectures on the history of dogma,
<i>Ausführlichere Vorlesungen über die christliche Dogmengeschichte</i>,
were published later by his son (1865-1868).</p>

<p>Baur&rsquo;s views were revolutionary and often extreme; but,
whatever may be thought of them, it is admitted that as a critic
he rendered a great service to theological science. &ldquo;One thing
is certain: New Testament study, since his time, has had a
different colour&rdquo; (H.S. Nash). He has had a number of disciples
or followers, who have in many cases modified his positions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUTAIN, LOUIS EUGÈNE MARIE<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (1796-1867), French

Normale he came under the influence of Cousin. In 1816 he
adopted the profession of higher teaching, and was soon after
called to the chair of philosophy in the university of Strassburg.
He held this position for many years, and gave a parallel course
of lectures as professor of the literary faculty in the same city.
The reaction against speculative philosophy, which carried
away De Maistre and Lamennais, influenced him also. In 1828
he took orders, and resigned his chair at the university. For
several years he remained at Strassburg, lecturing at the Faculty
and at the college of Juilly, but in 1840 he set out for Paris as
vicar of the diocese. At Paris he obtained considerable reputation
as an orator, and in 1853 was made professor of moral
theology at the theological faculty. This post he held till his
death. Like the Scholastics, he distinguished reason and faith,
and held that revelation supplies facts, otherwise unattainable,
which philosophy is able to group by scientific methods. Theology
and philosophy thus form one comprehensive science.
Yet Bautain was no rationalist; like Pascal and Newman he
exalted faith above reason. He pointed out, following chiefly
the Kantian criticism, that reason can never yield knowledge
of things in themselves. But there exists in addition to reason
another faculty which may be called intelligence, through which
we are put in connexion with spiritual and invisible truth.
This intelligence does not of itself yield a body of truth; it
merely contains the germs of the higher ideas, and these are made
productive by being brought into contact with revealed facts.
This fundamental conception Bautain worked out in the departments
of psychology and morals. The details of this theology
are highly imaginative. He says, for instance, that there is a
spirit of the world and a spirit of nature; the latter gives birth
to a physical and psychical spirit, and the physical spirit to the
animal and vegetable spirits. His theories may well be compared
with the arbitrary mysticism of van Helmont and the Gnostics.
The most important of his works are:&mdash;<i>Philosophie du Christianisme</i>
(1835); <i>Psychologic expérimentale</i> (1839), new edition
entitled <i>Esprit humain et ses facultés</i> (1859); <i>Philosophie
morale</i> (1840); <i>Religion et liberté</i> (1848); <i>La Morale de l&rsquo;évangile
comparée aux divers systèmes de morale</i> (Strassburg, 1827;
Paris, 1855); <i>De l&rsquo;éducation publique en France au XIX<span class="sp">e</span>
siècle</i> (Paris, 1876).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAUTZEN<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (Wendish <i>Budissin</i>, &ldquo;town&rdquo;), a town of Germany,
in the kingdom of Saxony and the capital of Saxon Upper
Lusatia. Pop. (1890) 21,515; (1905) 29,412. It occupies an
eminence on the right bank of the Spree, 680 ft. above the level
of the sea, 32 m. E.N.E. from Dresden, on the Dresden-Görlitz-Breslau
main line of railway, and at the junction of lines from
Schandau and Königswartha. The town is surrounded by walls,
and outside these again by ramparts, now in great measure turned
into promenades, and has extensive suburbs partly lying on the
left bank of the river. Among its churches the most remarkable
is the cathedral of St Peter, dating from the 15th century, with a
tower 300 ft. in height. It is used by both Protestants and Roman
Catholics, an iron screen separating the parts assigned to each.
There are five other churches, a handsome town hall, an orphan-asylum,
several hospitals, a mechanics&rsquo; institute, a famous
grammar school (gymnasium), a normal and several other schools,
and two public libraries. The general trade and manufactures are
considerable, including woollen (stockings and cloth), linen
and cotton goods, leather, paper, saltpetre, and dyeing. It
has also iron foundries, potteries, distilleries, breweries, cigar
factories, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Bautzen was already in existence when Henry I., the Fowler,
conquered Lusatia in 928. It became a town and fortress under
Otto I., his successor, and speedily attained considerable wealth
and importance, for a good share of which it was indebted to the
pilgrimages which were made to the &ldquo;arm of St Peter,&rdquo; preserved
in one of the churches. It suffered greatly during the Hussite
war, and still more during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, in the course of
which it was besieged and captured by the elector of Brandenburg,
John George (1620), fell into the hands of Wallenstein (1633), and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page542" id="page542"></a>542</span>
in the following year was burned by its commander before being
surrendered to the elector of Saxony. At the peace of Prague in
1635 it passed with Lusatia to Saxony as a war indemnity.</p>

<p>The town gives its name to a great battle in which, on the 20th
and 21st of May 1813, Napoleon I. defeated an allied army of
Russians and Prussians (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napoleonic Campaigns</a></span>).
The position chosen by the allies as that in which to
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Bautzen, 1813.</span>
receive the attack of Napoleon ran S.W. to N.E. from
Bautzen on the left to the village of Gleina on the right.
Bautzen itself was held as an advanced post of the left wing
(Russians), the main body of which lay 2 m. to the rear (E.) near
Jenkwitz. On the heights of Burk, 2½ m. N.E. of Bautzen, was
Kleist&rsquo;s Prussian corps, with Yorck&rsquo;s in support. On Kleist&rsquo;s
right at Pliskowitz (3 m. N.E. of Burk) lay Blücher&rsquo;s corps, and on
Blücher&rsquo;s right, formed at an angle to him, and refused towards
Gleina (7 m. N.E. by E. of Bautzen), were the Russians of Barclay
de Tolly. The country on which the battle was fought abounded
in strong defensive positions, some of which were famous as
battlegrounds of the Seven Years&rsquo; War. The whole line was
covered by the river Spree, which served as an immediate defence
for the left and centre, and an obstacle to any force moving to
attack the right; moreover the interval between the river and
the position on this side was covered with a network of ponds and
watercourses. Napoleon&rsquo;s right and centre approached (on a
broad front owing to the want of cavalry) from Dresden by
Bischofswerda and Kamenz; the left under Ney, which was
separated by nearly 40 m. from the left of the main body at
Luckau, was ordered to march via Hoyerswerda, Weissig and
Klix to strike the allies&rsquo; right. At noon on the 20th, Napoleon,
after a prolonged reconnaissance, advanced the main army against
Bautzen and Burk, leaving the enemy&rsquo;s right to be dealt with by
Ney on the morrow. He equally neglected the extreme left of the
allies in the mountains, judging it impossible to move his artillery
and cavalry in the broken ground there. Oudinot&rsquo;s (XII.) corps,
the extreme right wing, was to work round by the hilly country
to Jenkwitz in rear of Bautzen, Macdonald&rsquo;s (XI.) corps was to
assault Bautzen, and Marmont, with the VI. corps, to cross the
Spree and attack the Prussians posted about Burk. These three
corps were directed by Soult. Farther to the left, Bertrand&rsquo;s (IV.)
corps was held back to connect with Ney, who had then reached
Weissig with the head of his column. The Guard and other
general reserves were in rear of Macdonald and Marmont.
Bautzen was taken without difficulty; Oudinot and Marmont
easily passed the Spree on either side, and were formed up on the
other bank of the river by about 4 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> A heavy and indecisive
combat took place in the evening between Oudinot and the
Russian left, directed by the tsar in person, in which Oudinot&rsquo;s
men made a little progress towards Jenkwitz. Marmont&rsquo;s battle
was more serious. The Prussians were not experienced troops,
but were full of ardour and hatred of the French. Kleist made a
most stubborn resistance on the Burk ridge, and Bertrand&rsquo;s corps
was called up by Napoleon to join in the battle; but part of
Blücher&rsquo;s corps fiercely engaged Bertrand, and Burk was not
taken till 7 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> The French attack was much impeded by the
ground and by want of room to deploy between the river and the
enemy. But Napoleon&rsquo;s object in thus forcing the fighting in the
centre was achieved. The allies, feeling there the weight of the
French attack, gradually drew upon the reserves of their left and
right to sustain the shock. At nightfall Bautzen and Burk were
in possession of the French, and the allied line now stretched from
Jenkwitz northward to Pliskowitz, Blücher and Barclay maintaining
their original positions at Pliskowitz and Gleina. The
night of the 20th-21st was spent by both armies on the battlefield.
Napoleon cared little that the French centre was almost fought
out; it had fulfilled its mission, and on the 21st the decisive point
was to be Barclay&rsquo;s position. Soon after daybreak fighting was
renewed along the whole line; but Napoleon lay down to sleep
until the time appointed for Ney&rsquo;s attack. To a heavy counter-stroke
against Oudinot, which completely drove that marshal
from the ground won on the 20th, the emperor paid no more heed
than to order Macdonald to support the XII corps. For in this
second position of the allies, which was far more formidable than
the original line, the decisive result could be brought about only
by Ney. That commander had his own (III) corps, the corps of
Victor and of Lauriston and the Saxons under Reynier, a total
force of 60,000 men. Lauriston, at the head of the column, had
been sharply engaged on the 19th, but had spent the 20th in
calculated inaction. Early on the 21st the flank attack opened;
Ney and Lauriston moving direct upon Gleina, while Reynier and
Victor operated by a wide turning movement against Barclay&rsquo;s
right rear. The advance was carried out with precision; the
Russians were quickly dislodged, and Ney was now closing upon
the rear of Blücher&rsquo;s corps at the village of Preititz. Napoleon at
once ordered Soult&rsquo;s four corps to renew their attacks in order to
prevent the allies from reinforcing their right. But at the critical
moment Ney halted; his orders were to be in Preititz at 11 <span class="scs">A.M.</span>
and he reached that place an hour earlier. The respite of an hour
enabled the allies to organize a fierce counter-attack; Ney was
checked until the flanking columns of Victor and Reynier could
come upon the scene. At 1 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, when Ney resumed his advance,
it was too late to cut off the retreat of the allies. Napoleon now
made his final stroke. The Imperial Guard and all other troops
in the centre, 80,000 strong and covered by a great mass of
artillery, moved forward to the attack; and shortly the allied
centre, depleted of its reserves, which had been sent to oppose
Ney, was broken through and driven off the field. Blücher, now
almost surrounded, called back the troops opposing Ney to make
head against Soult, and Ney&rsquo;s four corps then carried all before
them. Preparations had been made by the allies, ever since Ney&rsquo;s
appearance, to break off the engagement, and now the tsar ordered
a general retreat eastwards, himself with the utmost skill and
bravery directing the rearguard. Thus the allies drew off
unharmed, leaving no trophies in the hands of Napoleon, whose
success, tactically unquestionable, was, for a variety of reasons,
and above all owing to the want of cavalry, a <i>coup manqué</i>
strategically. The troops engaged were, on the French side
163,000 men, on that of the allies about 100,000; and the losses
respectively about 20,000 and 13,500 killed and wounded.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAUXITE<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span>, a substance which has been considered to be a
mineral species, having the composition Al<span class="su">2</span>O(OH)<span class="su">4</span> (corresponding
with alumina 73.9, water 26.1%), and thus to be distinct
from the crystallized aluminium hydroxides, diaspore (AlO(OH))
and gibbsite (= hydrargillite, Al(OH)<span class="su">3</span>). It was first described by
P. Berthier in 1821 as &ldquo;alumine hydratée de Beaux,&rdquo; and was
named beauxite by P.A. Dufrénoy in 1847 and bauxite by
E.H. Sainte-Claire Deville in 1861; this name being derived
from the original locality, the village of Les Baux (or Beaux),
near Arles, dep. Bouches-du-Rhône in the south of France,
where the material has been for many years extensively mined as
an ore of aluminium. It is never found in a crystallized state,
but always as earthy, clay-like or concretionary masses, often
with a pisolitic structure. In colour it varies from white through
yellow and brown to red, depending on the amount and the
degree of hydration of the iron present. The specific gravity
also varies with the amount of iron; that of the variety known
as wocheinite (from near Lake Wochein, near Radmannsdorf, in
northern Carniola) is given as 2.55. The numerous chemical
analyses, which have mostly been made for technical purposes,
show that material known as bauxite varies very widely in
composition, the maximum and minimum percentages of each
constituent being as follows: alumina (Al<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>) 33.2-76.9;
water (H<span class="su">2</span>O) 8.6-31.4; iron oxide (Fe<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>) 0.1-48.8; silica
(SiO<span class="su">2</span>) 0.3-37.8; titanic acid (TiO<span class="su">2</span>) up to 4. The material is
thus usually very impure, being mixed with clay, quartz-sand
and hydroxides of iron in variable amounts, the presence of
which may be seen by a microscopical examination. Analyses
of purer material often approximate to diaspore or gibbsite in
composition, and minute crystalline scales of these minerals
have been detected under the microscope.</p>

<p>Bauxite can therefore scarcely be regarded as a simple mineral,
but rather as a mixture of gibbsite and diaspore with various
impurities; it is in fact strikingly like laterite, both in chemical
composition and in microscopical structure. Laterite is admittedly
a decomposition-product of igneous or other crystalline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page543" id="page543"></a>543</span>
rocks, and the same is no doubt also true of bauxite. The
deposits in Co. Antrim occur with pisolitic iron ore inter-bedded
with the Tertiary basalts, and similar deposits are met
with in connexion with the basaltic rocks of the Westerwald in
Germany. On the other hand, the more extensive deposits in
the south of France (departments Bouches-du-Rhône, Ariège,
Hérault, Var) and the southern United States (Georgia, Alabama,
Arkansas) are often associated with limestones; in this case the
origin of the bauxite has been ascribed to the chemical action of
solutions of aluminium sulphate on the limestones.</p>

<p>Bauxite is of value chiefly as a source of metallic aluminium
(<i>q.v.</i>); the material is first purified by chemical processes, after
which the aluminium hydroxide is reduced in the electric furnace.
Bauxite is also largely used in the manufacture of alum and
other aluminium salts used in dyeing. Its refractory qualities
render it available for the manufacture of fire-bricks and
crucibles.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAVAI,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> a town of northern France in the department of Nord,
15 m. E.S.E. of Valenciennes by rail. Pop. (1906) 1622. The
town carries on the manufacture of iron goods and of fertilizers.
Under the name of <i>Bagacum</i> or <i>Bavacum</i> it was the
capital of the Nervii and, under the Romans, an important centre
of roads, the meeting-place of which was marked by a milestone,
destroyed in the 17th century and replaced in the 19th century
by a column. Bavai was destroyed during the barbarian
invasions and never recovered its old importance. It suffered
much during the wars of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAVARIA<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (Ger. <i>Bayern</i>), a kingdom of southern Germany,
next to Prussia the largest state of the German empire in area
and population. It consists of two distinct and unequal portions.
Bavaria proper, and the Palatinate of the Rhine, which lie from
25 to 40 m. W. apart and are separated by the grand-duchies of
Baden and Hesse.</p>

<p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;Bavaria proper is bounded on the S. by
the Alps, on the N.E., towards Bohemia, by a long range of
mountains known as the Böhmerwald, on the N. by the Fichtelgebirge
and the Frankenwald, which separate it from the kingdom
of Saxony, the principality of Reuss, the duchies of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha
and Meiningen and the Prussian province of Hesse-Cassel.
The ranges seldom exceed the height of 3000 or 4000 ft.; but
the ridges in the south, towards Tirol, frequently attain an
elevation of 9000 or 10,000 ft. On the W. Bavaria is bounded
by Württemberg, Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt. The country
mainly belongs to the basins of the Danube and the Main; by
far the greater portion being drained by the former river, which,
entering from Swabia as a navigable stream, traverses the entire
breadth of the kingdom, with a winding course of 200 m., and
receives in its passage the Iller, the Lech, the Isar and the Inn
from the south, and the Naab, the Altmühl and the Wörnitz
from the north. The Inn is navigable before it enters Bavarian
territory, and afterwards receives the Salzach, a large river
flowing from Upper Austria. The Isar does not become navigable
till it has passed Munich; and the Lech is a stream of a similar
size. The Main traverses the northern regions, or Upper and
Lower Franconia, with a very winding course and greatly
facilitates the trade of the provinces. The district watered by
the southern tributaries of the Danube consists for the most
part of an extensive plateau, with a mean elevation of 2390 ft.
In the mountainous parts of the country there are numerous
lakes and in the lower portions considerable stretches of marshy
ground. The smaller or western portion, the Palatinate, is
bounded on the E. by the Rhine, which divides it from the grand-duchy
of Baden, on the S. by Alsace, and on the W. and N. by a
lofty range of hills, the Haardtgebirge, which separate it from
Lorraine and the Prussian Rhine province.</p>

<p>The climate of Bavaria differs greatly according to the character
of the region, being cold in the vicinity of Tirol but warm in the
plains adjoining the Danube and the Main. On the whole, the
temperature is in the winter months considerably colder than
that of England, and a good deal hotter during summer and
autumn.</p>

<p><i>Area and Population.</i>&mdash;Bavaria proper, or the eastern portion,
contains an area of 26,998 sq. m., and the Palatinate or western,
2288 sq. m., making the whole extent of the kingdom about
29,286 sq. m. The total population, according to the census of
1905, was 6,512,824. Almost a quarter of the inhabitants live
in towns, of which Munich and Nuremberg have populations
exceeding 100,000, Augsburg, Würzburg, Fürth and Ludwigshafen
between 50,000 and 100,000, while twenty-six other towns
number from 10,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>Ethnographically, the Bavarians belong to various ancient
tribes; Germanized Slavs in the north-east, Swabians and
Franks in the centre, Franks towards the west, and, in the
Palatinate, Walloons. Politically, the country is divided into
eight provinces, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i>&mdash;The majority of the inhabitants (about 70%) are
Roman Catholics. The Protestant-Evangelical Church claims
about 29%, while Jews, and a very small number of other sects,
account for the remainder.</p>

<p>The districts of Lower Bavaria, Upper Bavaria and the
Upper Palatinate are almost wholly Roman Catholic, while in
the Rhine Palatinate, Upper Franconia, and especially Middle
Franconia, the preponderance is on the side of the Protestants.
The exercise of religious worship in Bavaria is altogether free.
The Protestants have the same civil rights as the Roman
Catholics, and the sovereign may be either Roman Catholic or
Protestant. Of the Roman Catholic Church the heads are the
two archbishops of Munich-Freising and Bamberg, and the six
bishops of Eichstätt, Spires, Würzburg, Augsburg, Regensburg
and Passau, of whom the first three are suffragans of Bamberg.
The &ldquo;Old Catholic&rdquo; party, under the bishop of Bonn, has
failed, despite its early successes, to take deep root in the country.
Among the Protestants the highest authority is the general
consistory of Munich. The numbers of the different religions in
1900 were as follows:&mdash;Roman Catholics, 4,357,133; Protestants,
1,749,206; Jews, 54,928.</p>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;Bavaria, formerly backward in education, has
recently done much in this connexion. The state has two
Roman Catholic universities, Munich and Würzburg, and a
Lutheran, Erlangen; in Munich there are a polytechnic, an
academy of sciences and an academy of art.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;Of the total surface of Bavaria about one-half
is under cultivation, one-third forest, and the remaining sixth
mostly pasture. The level country, including both Lower
Bavaria (extending northwards to the Danube) and the western
and middle parts of Franconia, is productive of rye, oats, wheat,
barley and millet, and also of hemp, flax, madder and fruit and
vines. The last are grown chiefly in the vicinity of the Lake of
Constance, on the banks of the Main, in the lower part of its
course, and in the Palatinate of the Rhine. Hops are extensively
grown in central Franconia; tobacco (the best in Germany)
round Nuremberg and in the Palatinate, which also largely
produces the sugar-beet. Potatoes are cultivated in all the
provinces, but especially in the Palatinate and in the Spessart
district, which lies in the north-west within a curve of the Main.
The southern divisions of Swabia and Upper Bavaria, where
pasture-land predominates, form a cattle-breeding district and
the dairy produce is extensive. Here also horses are bred in
large numbers.</p>

<p>The extent of forest forms nearly a third of the total area of
Bavaria. This is owing to various causes: the amount of hilly
and mountainous country, the thinness of the population and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page544" id="page544"></a>544</span>
the necessity of keeping a given extent of ground under wood
for the supply of fuel. More than a third of the forests are
public property and furnish a considerable addition to the
revenue. They are principally situated in the provinces of
Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria and the Palatinate of the Rhine.
The forests are well stocked with game, deer, chamois (in the
Alps), wild boars, capercailzie, grouse, pheasants, &amp;c. being
plentiful. The greater proportion of the land throughout the
kingdom is in the hands of peasant proprietors, the extent of
the separate holdings differing very much in different districts.
The largest peasant property may be about 170 acres, and the
smallest, except in the Palatinate, about 50.</p>

<p><i>Minerals</i>.&mdash;The chief mineral deposits in Bavaria are coal,
iron ore, graphite and salt. The coal mines lie principally in
the districts of Amberg, Kissingen, Steben, Munich and the
Rhine Palatinate. Salt is obtained on a large scale partly from
brine springs and partly from mines, the principal centres being
Halle, Berchtesgaden, Traunstein and Rosenheim. The government
monopoly which had long existed was abolished in 1867
and free trade was established in salt between the members of
the customs-union. Of quicksilver there are several mines,
chiefly in the Palatinate of the Rhine; and small quantities of
copper, manganese and cobalt are obtained. There are numerous
quarries of excellent marble, alabaster, gypsum and building
stone; and the porcelain-clay is among the finest in Europe.
To these may be added emery, steatite, barytes, felspar and
ochre, in considerable quantities; excellent lithographic stone
is obtained at Solenhofen; and gold and silver are still worked,
but to an insignificant extent.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures and Trade</i>.&mdash;A great stimulus was given to
manufacturing industry in Bavaria by the law of 1868, which
abolished the last remains of the old restrictions of the gilds,
and gave the whole country the liberty which had been enjoyed
by the Rhine Palatinate alone. The chief centres of industry
are Munich, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Fürth, Erlangen, Aschaffenburg,
Regensburg, Würzburg, Bayreuth, Ansbach, Bamberg and
Hof in Bavaria proper, and in the Palatinate Spires and the
Rhine port of Ludwigshafen. The main centres of the hardware
industry are Munich, Nuremberg, Augsburg and Fürth; the two
first especially for locomotives and automobiles, the last for tinfoil
and metal toys. Aschaffenburg manufactures fancy goods,
Augsburg and Hof produce excellent cloth, and Munich has a
great reputation for scientific instruments. In Franconia are
numerous paper-mills, and the manufacture of wooden toys is
largely carried on in the forest districts of Upper Bavaria. A
considerable quantity of glass is made, particularly in the Böhmerwald.
Brewing forms an important industry, the best-known
breweries being those of Munich, Nuremberg, Erlangen and
Kulmbach. Other articles of manufacture are leather, tobacco,
porcelain, cement, spirits, lead pencils (Nuremberg), plate-glass,
sugar, matches, aniline dyes, straw hats and baskets. The
commerce of Bavaria is very considerable. The exports consist
chiefly of corn, potatoes, hops, beer, wine, cloth, cotton goods,
glass, fancy wares, toys, cattle, pigs and vegetables. The seat
of the hop-trade is Nuremberg; of wool, Augsburg. The imports
comprise sugar, tobacco, cocoa, coffee, oils, silk and pig iron.</p>

<p><i>Communications</i>.&mdash;Trade is served by an excellent railway
system and there are steamboat services on the navigable rivers,
to the east by way of Passau on the Danube, and to the west by
Ludwigshafen. The high roads of Bavaria, many of which are
military roads laid out at the beginning of the 19th century,
extend in all over about 10,000 m. There were 4377 m. of
railways in operation in 1904, of which about 3800 were in the
hands of the state, and about 440 m. belonged to the private
system of the Palatinate. The principal canal is the Ludwigskanal,
which connects the Rhine with the Danube, extending
from Bamberg on the Regnitz to Dietfurt on the Altmühl.
There is an extensive network of telegraph and telephone lines.
All belong to the government post office, which forms an administrative
system independent of the imperial German post office.</p>

<p><i>Constitution and Administration</i>.&mdash;By the treaty of Versailles
(23rd November 1870) and the imperial constitution of the 16th
of April 1871, Bavaria was incorporated with the German
empire, reserving, however, certain separate privileges (<i>Sonderrechte</i>)
in respect of the administration of the army, the railways
and the posts, the excise duties on beer, the rights of domicile
and the insurance of real estate. The king is the supreme chief
of the army, and matters requiring adjudication in the adjutant-general&rsquo;s
court are referred to a special Bavarian court attached
to the supreme imperial military tribunal in Berlin. Bavaria
is represented in the Bundesrat by six votes and sends forty-eight
deputies to the imperial diet. The Bavarian constitution is
mainly founded on the constitutional act of the 26th of May
1818, modified by subsequent acts&mdash;that of the 9th of March
1828 as affecting the upper house, and those of the 4th of June
1848 and of the 21st of March 1881 as affecting the lower&mdash;and
is a limited monarchy, with a legislative body of two houses.
The crown is hereditary in the house of Wittelsbach, according
to the rights of primogeniture, females being excluded from
succession so long as male agnates of equal birth exist. The
title of the sovereign is king of Bavaria, that of his presumptive
heir is crown-prince of Bavaria, and during the minority or
incapacity of the sovereign a regency is declared, which is vested
in the nearest male agnate capable of ascending the throne.
Such a regency began on the 10th of June 1886, at first for King
Louis II., and after the 14th of the same month for King Otto I.,
in the person of the prince regent Luitpold. The executive
power resides in the king and the responsibility for the government
of the kingdom in his ministers. The royal family is Roman
Catholic, and the seat of government is Munich, the capital.</p>

<p>The upper house of the Bavarian parliament (<i>Kammer der
Reichsräte</i>) is composed of (1) the princes of the blood royal
(being of full age), (2) the ministers of the crown, (3) the archbishops
of Munich, Freising and Bamberg, (4) the heads of such
noble families as were formerly &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; so long as they
retain their ancient possessions in Bavaria, (5) of a Roman
Catholic bishop appointed by the king for life, and of the president
for the time being of the Protestant consistory, (6) of
hereditary counsellors (<i>Reichsräte</i>) appointed by the king, and
(7) of other counsellors appointed by the king for life. The
lower house (<i>Kammer der Abgeordneten</i>) or chamber of representatives,
consists, since 1881, of 159 deputies, in proportion
of one&mdash;reckoned on the census of 1875&mdash;to every 31,500 inhabitants.
A general election takes place every six years, and, under
the electoral law of 1906, is direct. Qualifications for the general
body of electors are full age of twenty-five years, Bavarian
citizenship of one year at least, and discharge of all rates and
taxes. Parliament must be assembled every three years, but as
the budget is taken every two years, it is regularly called together
within that period. No laws affecting the liberty or property of
the subject can be passed without the sanction of parliament.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">History</p>

<p>The earliest known inhabitants of the district afterwards called
Bavaria were a people, probably of Celtic extraction, who were
subdued by the Romans just before the opening of the Christian
era, when colonies were founded among them and their land was
included in the province of Raetia. During the 5th century it
was ravaged by the troops of Odoacer and, after being almost
denuded of inhabitants, was occupied by tribes who, pushing
along the valley of the Danube, settled there between <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 488
and 520. Many conjectures have been formed concerning the
race and origin of these people, who were certainly a new and
composite social aggregate. Most likely they were descendants
of the Marcomanni, Quadi and Narisci, tribes of the Suevic or
Swabian race, with possibly a small intermixture of Gothic or
Celtic elements. They were called <i>Baioarii, Baiowarii, Bawarii</i>
or <i>Baiuwarii</i>, words derived most probably from <i>Baja</i> or <i>Baya</i>,
corruptions of <i>Bojer</i>, and given to them because they came from
<i>Bojerland</i> or <i>Bohemia</i>. Another but less probable explanation
derives the name from a combination of the old high German
word <i>uuâra</i>, meaning league, and <i>bai</i>, a Gothic word for both.
The Bavarians are first mentioned in a Frankish document of
520, and twenty years later Jordanes refers to them as lying east
of the Swabians. Their country bore some traces of Roman
influence, and its main boundaries were the Enns, the Danube,
the Lech and the Alps; but its complete settlement was a work
of time.</p>

<p>The Bavarians soon came under the dominion of the Franks,
probably without a serious struggle; and were ruled from 555
to 788 by dukes of the Agilolfing family, who were
possibly of Frankish descent. For a century and a
<span class="sidenote">Frankish influence.</span>
half a succession of dukes resisted the inroads of
the Slavs on their eastern frontier, and by the time of Duke
Theodo I., who died in 717, were completely independent of the
feeble Frankish kings. When Charles Martel became the virtual
ruler of the Frankish realm he brought the Bavarians into strict
dependence, and deposed two dukes successively for contumacy.
Pippin the Short was equally successful in maintaining his
authority, and several marriages took place between the family
to which he belonged and the Agilolfings, who were united in a
similar manner with the kings of the Lombards. The ease with
which various risings were suppressed by the Franks gives colour
to the supposition that they were rather the outcome of family
quarrels than the revolt of an oppressed people. Between the
years 739 and 748 the Bavarian law was committed to writing
and supplementary clauses were afterwards added, all of which
bear evident traces of Frankish influence. Thus, while the
dukedom belongs to the Agilolfing family, the duke must be
chosen by the people and his election confirmed by the Frankish
king, to whom he owes fealty. He has a fivefold wergild,
summons the nobles and clergy for purposes of deliberation,
calls out the host, administers justice and regulates finance.
There are five noble families, possibly representing a former
division of the people, after whom come the freeborn, and then
the freedmen. The country is divided into <i>gaus</i> or counties,
under their counts, who are assisted by judges responsible for
declaring the law.</p>

<p>Christianity had lingered in Bavaria from Roman times;
but a new era set in when Rupert, bishop of Worms, came to
the country at the invitation of Duke Theodo I. in 696. He
founded several monasteries, and a similar work was also performed
by St Emmeran, bishop of Poitiers; with the result
<span class="sidenote">Christianity.</span>
that before long the bulk of the people professed
Christianity and relations were established between
Bavaria and Rome. The 8th century witnessed indeed
a heathen reaction; but it was checked by the arrival in
Bavaria about 734 of St. Boniface, who organized the Bavarian
church and founded or restored bishoprics at Salzburg, Freising,
Regensburg and Passau.</p>

<p>Tassilo III., who became duke of the Bavarians in 749,
recognized the supremacy of the Frankish king Pippin the Short
in 757, but soon afterwards refused to furnish a contribution
to the war in Aquitaine. Moreover, during
<span class="sidenote">Frankish conquest.</span>
the early years of the reign of Charlemagne, Tassilo
gave decisions in ecclesiastical and civil causes in his own name,
refused to appear in the assemblies of the Franks, and in general
acted as an independent ruler. His position as possessor of the
Alpine passes, as an ally of the Avars, and as son-in-law of the
Lombard king Desiderius, was so serious a menace to the Frankish
kingdom that Charlemagne determined to crush him. The
details of this contest are obscure. Tassilo appears to have done
homage in 781, and again in 787, probably owing to the presence
of Frankish armies. But further trouble soon arose, and in 788
the duke was summoned to Ingelheim, where on a charge of
treachery he was sentenced to death. He was, however, pardoned
by the king; and he then entered a monastery and
formally renounced his duchy at Frankfort in 794. The country
was ruled by Gerold, a brother-in-law of Charlemagne, till
his death in a battle with the Avars in 799, when its administration
was entrusted to Frankish counts and assimilated with
that of the rest of the Carolingian empire, while its condition
was improved by the measures taken by Charlemagne for the
intellectual progress and material welfare of his realm. The
Bavarians offered no resistance to the change which thus abolished
their dukedom; and their incorporation with the Frankish
dominions, due mainly to the unifying influence of the church,
was already so complete that Charlemagne did not find it
necessary to issue more than two capitularies dealing especially
with Bavarian affairs.</p>

<p>The history of Bavaria for the ensuing century is bound up
with that of the Carolingian empire. Given at the partition of
817 to the king of the East Franks, Louis the German,
it formed part of the larger territories which were
<span class="sidenote">Union with Carolingian Empire.</span>
confirmed to him in 843 by the treaty of Verdun,
Louis made Regensburg the centre of his government,
and was active in improving the condition of Bavaria, and providing
for its security by numerous campaigns against the Slavs.
When he divided his possessions in 865 it passed to his eldest son,
Carloman, who had already undertaken its government, and
after his death in 880 it formed part of the extensive territories
of the emperor Charles the Fat. Its defence was left by this
incompetent emperor to Arnulf, an illegitimate son of Carloman,
and it was mainly owing to the support of the Bavarians that
Arnulf was able to take the field against Charles in 887, and to
secure his own election as German king in the following year.
Bavaria, which was the centre of the East Frankish kingdom,
passed in 899 to Louis the Child, during whose reign it was
constantly ravaged by the Hungarians. The resistance to these
inroads became gradually feebler, and it is said that on the
5th of July 907 almost the whole of the Bavarian race perished
in battle with these formidable enemies. For the defence of
Bavaria the mark of Carinthia had been erected on the south-eastern
frontier, and during the reign of Louis the Child this was
ruled by Liutpold, count of Scheyern, who possessed large
domains in Bavaria. He was among those who fell in the great
fight of 907; but his son Arnulf, surnamed the Bad, rallied the
remnants of the race, drove back the Hungarians, and was
chosen duke of the Bavarians in 911, when Bavaria and Carinthia
were united under his rule. Refusing to acknowledge the
supremacy of the German king Conrad I., he was unsuccessfully
attacked by the latter, and in 920 was recognized as duke by
Conrad&rsquo;s successor, Henry I., the Fowler, who admitted his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page546" id="page546"></a>546</span>
right to appoint the bishops, to coin money and to issue laws.
A similar conflict took place between Arnulf&rsquo;s son and successor
<span class="sidenote">Part of the German Kingdom.</span>
Eberhard and Otto the Great; but Eberhard was
less successful than his father, for in 938 he was driven
from Bavaria, which was given by Otto with reduced
privileges to the late duke&rsquo;s uncle, Bertold; and a
count palatine in the person of Eberhard&rsquo;s brother Arnulf was
appointed to watch the royal interests. When Bertold died in
947 Otto conferred the duchy upon his own brother Henry, who
had married Judith, a daughter of Duke Arnulf. Henry was
disliked by the Bavarians and his short reign was spent mainly
in disputes with his people. The ravages of the Hungarians
ceased after their defeat on the Lechfeld in 955, and the area of
the duchy was temporarily increased by the addition of certain
adjacent districts in Italy. In 955 Henry was succeeded by his
young son Henry, surnamed the Quarrelsome, who in 974 was
implicated in a conspiracy against King Otto II. The reason for
this rising was that the king had granted the duchy of Swabia
to Henry&rsquo;s enemy, Otto, a grandson of the emperor Otto the
Great, and had given the new Bavarian East Mark, afterwards
known as Austria, to Leopold I., count of Babenberg. The
revolt was, however, soon suppressed; but Henry, who on his
escape from prison renewed his plots, was formally deposed in
976 when Bavaria was given to Otto, duke of Swabia. At the
same time Carinthia was made into a separate duchy, the office
of count palatine was restored, and the church was made
dependent on the king instead of on the duke. Restored in
985, Henry proved himself a capable ruler by establishing
internal order, issuing important laws and taking measures to
reform the monasteries. His son and successor, who was chosen
German king as Henry II. in 1002, gave Bavaria to his
brother-in-law Henry of Luxemburg; after whose death in 1026 it
passed successively to Henry, afterwards the emperor Henry III.,
and to another member of the family of Luxemburg, as Duke
Henry VII. In 1061 the empress Agnes, mother of and regent
for the German king Henry IV., entrusted the duchy to Otto of
<span class="sidenote">The duchy passes to the Welfs.</span>
Nordheim, who was deposed by the king in 1070,
when the duchy was granted to Count Welf, a member
of an influential Bavarian family. In consequence of
his support of Pope Greegory VII. in his quarrel with
Henry, Welf lost but subsequently regained Bavaria; and was
followed successively by his sons, Welf II. in 1101, and Henry IX.
in 1120, both of whom exercised considerable influence among
the German princes. Henry was succeeded in 1126 by his son
Henry X., called the Proud, who obtained the duchy of Saxony
in 1137. Alarmed at this prince&rsquo;s power, King Conrad III.
refused to allow two duchies to remain in the same hands; and,
having declared Henry deposed, he bestowed Bavaria upon
Leopold IV., margrave of Austria. When Leopold died in 1141,
the king retained the duchy himself; but it continued to be the
scene of considerable disorder, and in 1143 he entrusted it to
Henry II., surnamed Jasomirgott, margrave of Austria. The
struggle for its possession continued until 1156, when King
Frederick I. in his desire to restore peace to Germany persuaded
Henry to give up Bavaria to Henry the Lion, a son of Duke
Henry the Proud.</p>

<p>A new era of government set in when, in consequence of Henry
being placed under the imperial ban in 1180, the duchy was given
by Frederick I. to Otto, a member of the old Bavarian
family of Wittelsbach (<i>q.v.</i>), and a descendant of the
<span class="sidenote">Then to the Wittelsbachs.<br />Area of Bavaria.</span>
counts of Scheyern. During the years following the
destruction of the Carolingian empire the borders of
Bavaria were continually changing, and for a lengthened period
after 955 this process was one of expansion.  To the west the
Lech still divided Bavaria from Swabia, but on three
other sides the opportunities for extension had been
taken advantage of, and the duchy embraced an area
of considerable dimensions north of the Danube. During the
later years of the rule of the Welfs, however, a contrary tendency
had operated, and the extent of Bavaria had been reduced. The
immense energies of Duke Henry the Lion had been devoted to
his northern rather than his southern duchy, and when the
dispute over the Bavarian succession was settled in 1156 the
district between the Enns and the Inn had been transferred to
Austria. The increasing importance of the mark of Styria,
erected into a duchy in 1180, and the county of Tirol, had
diminished both the actual and the relative strength of Bavaria,
which was now deprived on almost all sides of opportunities for
expansion. The neighbouring duchy of Carinthia, the great
temporal possessions of the archbishop of Salzburg, as well as a
general tendency to independence on the part of both clerical
and lay nobles, were additional forces of similar influence.</p>

<p>When Otto of Wittelsbach was invested with Bavaria at
Altenburg in September 1180 the duchy was bounded by the
Böhmerwald, the Inn, the Alps and the Lech; and
the power of the duke was practically confined to his
<span class="sidenote">Rule of the Wittelsbachs.</span>
extensive private domains around Wittelsbach, Kelheim
and Straubing. Otto only enjoyed his new dignity for
three years, and was succeeded in 1183 by his son Louis I., who
took a leading part in German affairs during the earlier years of
the reign of the emperor Frederick II., and was assassinated at
Kelheim in September 1231. His son Otto II., called the
Illustrious, was the next duke, and his loyalty to the Hohenstaufen
caused him to be placed under the papal ban, and
Bavaria to be laid under an interdict. Like his father, Otto
increased the area of his lands by purchases; and he had considerably
strengthened his hold upon the duchy before he died
in November 1253. The efforts of the dukes to increase their
power and to give unity to the duchy had met with a fair measure
of success; but they were soon vitiated by partitions among
different members of the family which for 250 years made the
<span class="sidenote">Division of the duchy.</span>
history of Bavaria little more than a jejune chronicle
of territorial divisions bringing war and weakness in
their train. The first of these divisions was made in
1255 between Louis II. and Henry I., the sons of Duke
Otto II., who for two years after their father&rsquo;s death had ruled
Bavaria jointly; and by it Louis obtained the western part of
the duchy, afterwards called Upper Bavaria, and
<span class="sidenote">Upper Bavaria.</span>
Henry secured eastern or Lower Bavaria.  In the
course of a long reign Louis, who was called the Stern,
became the most powerful prince in southern Germany. He was
the uncle and guardian of Conradin of Hohenstaufen, and when
this prince was put to death in Italy in 1268, Louis and his brother
Henry inherited the domains of the Hohenstaufen in Swabia and
elsewhere. He supported Rudolph, count of Habsburg, in his
efforts to secure the German throne in 1273, married the new
king&rsquo;s daughter Mechtild, and aided him in campaigns in
Bohemia and elsewhere. For some years after Louis&rsquo; death in
1294 his sons Rudolph I. and Louis, afterwards the emperor
Louis IV., ruled their duchy in common; but as their relations
were never harmonious a division of Upper Bavaria was made in
1310, by which Rudolph received the land east of the Isar
together with the town of Munich, and Louis the district between
the Isar and the Lech. It was not long, however, before this
arrangement led to war between the brothers, the outcome of
which was that in 1317, three years after he had been chosen
German king, Louis compelled Rudolph to abdicate, and for
twelve years ruled alone over the whole of Upper Bavaria. But
in 1329 a series of events induced him to conclude the treaty of
Pavia with Rudolph&rsquo;s sons, Rudolph and Rupert, to whom he
transferred the Palatinate of the Rhine, which had been in the
possession of the Wittelsbach family since 1214, and also a portion
of Upper Bavaria north of the Danube, which was afterwards
called the Upper Palatinate. At the same time it was decided
that the electoral vote should be exercised by the two lines alternately,
and that in the event of either branch of the family becoming
extinct the surviving branch should inherit its possessions.</p>

<p>Henry I. of Lower Bavaria spent most of his time in quarrels
with his brother, with Ottakar II. of Bohemia and with various
ecclesiastics. When he died in February 1200 Lower
Bavaria was ruled by his three sons, Otto III., Louis
<span class="sidenote">Lower Bavaria.</span>
III. and Stephen I. Louis died childless in 1296;
Stephen left two sons at his death in 1310, namely, Henry II.
and Otto IV., and Otto, who was king of Hungary from 1305 to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page547" id="page547"></a>547</span>
1308, died in 1312, leaving a son, Henry III. Lower Bavaria
was governed by these three princes until 1333, when Henry III.
died, followed in 1334 by his cousin Otto; and as both died
without sons the whole of Lower Bavaria then passed to Henry II.
Dying in 1339, Henry left an only son, John I., who died childless
<span class="sidenote">Reunion of the duchy.</span>
in the following year, when the emperor Louis IV., by
securing Lower Bavaria for himself, united the whole
of the duchy under his sway. The consolidation of
Bavaria under Louis lasted for seven years, during
which the emperor was able to improve the condition of the
country. When he died in 1347 he left six sons to share his
possessions, who agreed upon a division of Bavaria in 1349. Its
history, however, was complicated by its connexion with Brandenburg,
Holland and Tirol, all of which had also been left by
the emperor to his sons. All the six brothers exercised some
authority in Bavaria; but three alone left issue, and of these
the eldest, Louis, margrave of Brandenburg, died in 1361;
and two years later was followed to the grave by his only son
Meinhard, who was childless. The two remaining brothers,
Stephen II. and Albert I., ruled over Bavaria-Landshut and
Bavaria-Straubing respectively, and when Stephen died in 1375
his portion of Bavaria was governed jointly by his three sons.
In 1392, when all the lines except those of Stephen and Albert
had died out, an important partition took place, by which the
greater part of the duchy was divided among Stephen&rsquo;s three
sons, Stephen III., Frederick and John II., who founded respectively
the lines of Ingolstadt, Landshut and Munich. Albert&rsquo;s
duchy of Bavaria-Straubing passed on his death in 1404 to his
son William II., and in 1417 to his younger son John, who
resigned the bishopric of Liége to take up his new position.
When John died in 1425 this family became extinct, and after
a contest between various claimants Bavaria-Straubing was
divided between the three remaining branches of the family.</p>

<p>The main result of the threefold division of 1392 was a succession
of civil wars which led to the temporary eclipse of Bavaria
as a force in German politics. Neighbouring states
encroached upon its borders, and the nobles ignored
<span class="sidenote">Internal condition 1392.</span>
the authority of the dukes, who, deprived of the electoral
vote, were mainly occupied for fifty years with
intestine strife. This condition of affairs, however, was not
wholly harmful. The government of the country and the control
of the finances passed mainly into the hands of an assembly
called the <i>Landtag</i> or <i>Landschaft</i>, which had been organized in
1392. The towns, assuming a certain independence, became
strong and wealthy as trade increased, and the citizens of
Munich and Regensburg were often formidable antagonists to
the dukes. Thus a period of disorder saw the growth of representative
institutions and the establishment of a strong civic
spirit. Stephen III., duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, was distinguished
rather as a soldier than as a statesman; and his rule
was marked by struggles with various towns, and with his
<span class="sidenote">Intestine troubles.</span>
brother, John of Bavaria-Munich. Dying in 1413 he
was followed by his son, Louis, called the Bearded,
a restless and quarrelsome prince, who before his
accession had played an important part in the affairs of France,
where his sister Isabella was the queen of King Charles VI.
About 1417 he became involved in a violent quarrel with his
cousin, Henry of Bavaria-Landshut, fell under both the papal
and the imperial ban, and in 1439 was attacked by his son Louis
the Lame. This prince, who had married a daughter of Frederick
I. of Hohenzollern, margrave of Brandenburg, was incensed at
the favour shown by his father to an illegitimate son. Aided by
Albert Achilles, afterwards margrave of Brandenburg, he took
the elder Louis prisoner and compelled him to abdicate in 1443.
When Louis the Lame died in 1445 his father came into the power
of his implacable enemy, Henry of Bavaria-Landshut, and died
in prison in 1447. The duchy of Bavaria-Ingolstadt passed to
Henry, who had succeeded his father Frederick as duke of
Bavaria-Landshut in 1393, and whose long reign was almost
entirely occupied with family feuds. He died in July 1450, and
was followed by his son, Louis IX. (called the Rich), and about
this time Bavaria began to recover some of its former importance.
Louis IX. expelled the Jews from his duchy, did something for
the security of traders, and improved both the administration of
justice and the condition of the finances. In 1472 he founded
the university of Ingolstadt, attempted to reform the monasteries,
and was successful in a struggle with Albert Achilles of Brandenburg.
On his death in January 1479 he was succeeded by his son
George, also called the Rich; and when George, a faithful
adherent of the German king Maximilian I., died without sons in
December 1503, a war broke out for the possession of his duchy.</p>

<p>Bavaria-Munich passed on the death of John II. in 1397 to his
sons Ernest and William III., but they only obtained possession of
their lands after a struggle with Stephen of Bavaria-Ingolstadt.
Both brothers were then engaged in warfare with the other
branches of the family and with the citizens of Munich. William,
a loyal servant of the emperor Sigismund, died in 1435, leaving an
only son, Adolf, who died five years later; and Ernest, distinguished
for his bodily strength, died in 1438. In 1440 the whole
of Bavaria-Munich came to Ernest&rsquo;s son Albert, who had been
estranged from his father owing to his union with the unfortunate
Agnes Bernauer (<i>q.v.</i>). Albert, whose attempts to reform the
monasteries earned for him the surname of Pious, was almost
elected king of Bohemia in 1440. He died in 1460, leaving five
sons, the two elder of whom, John IV. and Sigismund, reigned in
common until the death of John in 1463. The third brother,
Albert, who had been educated for the church, joined his brother
in 1465, and when Sigismund abdicated two years later became
sole ruler in spite of the claims of his two younger brothers.
Albert, who was called the Wise, added the district of Abensberg
to his possessions, and in 1504 became involved in the war which
<span class="sidenote">War over the succession to Bavaria-Landshut.</span>
broke out for the possession of Bavaria-Landshut on the
death of George the Rich. Albert&rsquo;s rival was George&rsquo;s
son-in-law, Rupert, formerly bishop of Freising, and son
of Philip, count palatine of the Rhine; and the emperor
Maximilian I., interested as archduke of Austria and
count of Tirol, interfered in the dispute. Rupert died in 1504,
and the following year an arrangement was made at the diet of
Cologne by which the emperor and Philip&rsquo;s grandson, Otto Henry,
obtained certain outlying districts, while Albert by securing the
bulk of George&rsquo;s possessions united Bavaria under his rule. In
1506 Albert decreed that the duchy should pass undivided
<span class="sidenote">Reigns of Albert the Wise and William IV.</span>
according to the rules of primogeniture, and
endeavoured in other ways also to consolidate Bavaria.
He was partially successful in improving the condition
of the country; and in 1500 Bavaria formed one of the
six circles into which Germany was divided for the maintenance
of peace. He died in March 1508, and was succeeded by his son,
William IV., whose mother, Kunigunde, was a daughter of the
emperor Frederick III. In spite of the decree of 1506 William was
compelled in 1516, after a violent quarrel, to grant a share in the
government to his brother Louis, an arrangement which lasted
until the death of Louis in 1545.</p>

<p>William followed the traditional Wittelsbach policy, opposition
to the Habsburgs, until in 1534 he made a treaty at Linz with
Ferdinand, king of Hungary and Bohemia. This was strengthened
in 1546, when the emperor Charles V. obtained the help of the duke
during the war of the league of Schmalkalden by promising him
in certain eventualities the succession to the Bohemian throne,
and the electoral dignity enjoyed by the count palatine of the
Rhine. William also did much at a critical period to secure
<span class="sidenote">Roman Catholicism in Bavaria.</span>
Bavaria for Catholicism. The reformed doctrines had
made considerable progress in the duchy when the duke
from the pope extensive rights over the
bishoprics and monasteries, and took measures to repress
the reformers, many of whom were banished; while the
Jesuits, whom he invited into the duchy in 1541, made the university
of Ingolstadt their headquarters for Germany. William,
whose death occurred in March 1550, was succeeded by his son
Albert IV., who had married a daughter of Ferdinand of Habsburg,
afterwards the emperor Ferdinand I. Early in his reign Albert
made some concessions to the reformers, who were still strong in
Bavaria; but about 1563 he changed his attitude, favoured the
decrees of the council of Trent, and pressed forward the work of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page548" id="page548"></a>548</span>
the Counter-Reformation. As education passed by degrees into
the hands of the Jesuits the progress of Protestantism was
effectually arrested in Bavaria. Albert IV. was a great patron of
art. His court at Munich was the resort of artists of all kinds, and
the city was enriched with splendid buildings; while artistic
works were collected from Italy and elsewhere. The expenses of
a magnificent court led the duke to quarrel with the <i>Landschaft</i>,
to oppress his subjects, and to leave a great burden of debt when
he died in October 1579. The succeeding duke was Albert&rsquo;s son,
William V. (called the Pious), who was educated by the Jesuits and
was keenly attached to their tenets. He secured the archbishopric
of Cologne for his brother Ernest in 1583, and this dignity
remained in the possession of the family for nearly 200 years. In
<span class="sidenote">Reign of Maximillian I. and the Thirty Years&rsquo; War.</span>
1597 he abdicated in favour of his son Maximilian I.,
and retired into a monastery, where he died in 1626.
Maximilian found the duchy encumbered with debt and
filled with disorder, but ten years of his vigorous rule
effected a remarkable change. The finances and the
judicial system were reorganized, a class of civil servants
and a national militia founded, and several small districts
were brought under the duke&rsquo;s authority. The result was a unity
and order in the duchy which enabled Maximilian to play an important
part in the Thirty Years&rsquo; War; during the earlier years
of which he was so successful as to acquire the Upper Palatinate
and the electoral dignity which had been enjoyed since 1356 by the
elder branch of the Wittelsbach family. In spite of subsequent
reverses these gains were retained by Maximilian at the peace of
Westphalia in 1648. During the later years of this war Bavaria,
especially the northern part, suffered severely. In 1632 it was
invaded by the Swedes, and, when Maximilian violated the treaty
of Ulm in 1647, was ravaged by the French and the Swedes.
After repairing this damage to some extent, the elector died at
Ingolstadt in September 1651, leaving his duchy much stronger
than he had found it. The recovery of the Upper Palatinate made
Bavaria compact; the acquisition of the electoral vote made it
influential; and the duchy was able to play a part in European
politics which intestine strife had rendered impossible for the past
four hundred years.</p>
<div class="author">(A. W. H.*)</div>

<p>Whatever lustre the international position won by Maximilian
I. might add to the ducal house, on Bavaria itself its effect during
the next two centuries was more dubious. Maximillian&rsquo;s
son, Ferdinand Maria (1651-1679), who was a
<span class="sidenote">Beginning of modern period.</span>
minor when he succeeded, did much indeed to repair
the wounds caused by the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, encouraging
agriculture and industries, and building or restoring
numerous churches and monasteries. In 1669, moreover, he
again called a meeting of the diet, which had been suspended
since 1612. His good work, however, was largely undone by his
son Maximilian II. Emmanuel (1679-1726), whose far-reaching
ambition set him warring against the Turks and, on the side of
France, in the great struggle of the Spanish succession. He
shared in the defeat at Höchstädt on the 13th of August 1704;
his dominions were temporarily partitioned between Austria
and the elector palatine, and only restored to him, harried and
exhausted, at the peace of Baden in 1714. Untaught by Maximilian
Emmanuel&rsquo;s experience, his son, Charles Albert (1726-1745),
devoted all his energies to increasing the European
prestige and power of his house. The death of the emperor
Charles VI. was his opportunity; he disputed the validity of the
Pragmatic Sanction which secured the Habsburg succession to
Maria Theresa, allied himself with France, conquered Upper
Austria, was crowned king of Bohemia at Prague and, in 1742,
emperor at Frankfort. The price he had to pay, however, was
the occupation of Bavaria itself by Austrian troops; and,
though the invasion of Bohemia in 1744 by Frederick II. of
Prussia enabled him to return to Munich, at his death on the
20th of January 1745 it was left to his successor to make what
terms he could for the recovery of his dominions. Maximilian
III. Joseph (1745-1777), by the peace of Füssen signed on the
22nd of April 1745, obtained the restitution of his dominions in
return for a formal acknowledgment of the Pragmatic Sanction.
He was a man of enlightenment, did much to encourage agriculture,
industries and the exploitation of the mineral wealth of
the country, founded the Academy of Sciences at Munich, and
abolished the Jesuit censorship of the press. At his death,
without issue, on the 30th of December 1777, the Bavarian line
of the Wittelsbachs became extinct, and the succession passed
to Charles Theodore, the elector palatine. After a separation of
four and a half centuries, the Palatinate, to which the
<span class="sidenote">Re-union of the Palatinate.</span>
duchies of Jülich and Berg had been added, was thus
reunited with Bavaria. So great an accession of
strength to a neighbouring state, whose ambition she
had so recently had just reason to fear, was intolerable to Austria,
which laid claim to a number of lordships&mdash;forming one-third of
the whole Bavarian inheritance&mdash;as lapsed fiefs of the Bohemian,
Austrian, and imperial crowns. These were at once occupied by
Austrian troops, with the secret consent of Charles Theodore
himself, who was without legitimate heirs, and wished to obtain
from the emperor the elevation of his natural children to the
status of princes of the Empire. The protests of the next heir,
Charles, duke of Zweibrücken (Deux-Ponts), supported by the
king of Prussia, led to the war of Bavarian succession. By the
peace of Teschen (May 13th, 1779) the Inn quarter was ceded to
Austria, and the succession secured to Charles of Zweibrücken.
For Bavaria itself Charles Theodore did less than nothing. He
felt himself a foreigner among foreigners, and his favourite
scheme, the subject of endless intrigues with the Austrian
cabinet and the immediate cause of Frederick II.&rsquo;s League of
Princes (<i>Fürstenbund</i>) of 1785, was to exchange Bavaria for the
Austrian Netherlands and the title of king of Burgundy. For the
rest, the enlightened internal policy of his predecessor was
abandoned. The funds of the suppressed order of Jesus, which
Maximilian Joseph had destined for the reform of the educational
system of the country, were used to endow a province of the
knights of St John of Jerusalem, for the purpose of combating the
enemies of the faith. The government was inspired by the
narrowest clericalism, which culminated in the attempt to
withdraw the Bavarian bishops from the jurisdiction of the great
German metropolitans and place them directly under that of the
pope. On the eve of the Revolution the intellectual and social
condition of Bavaria remained that of the middle ages.</p>

<p>In 1792 the revolutionary armies overran the Palatinate; in
1795 the French, under Moreau, invaded Bavaria itself, advanced
to Munich&mdash;where they were received with joy by the
long-suppressed Liberals&mdash;and laid siege to Ingolstadt.
<span class="sidenote">The revolutionary wars.</span>
Charles Theodore, who had done nothing to prevent
or to resist the invasion, fled to Saxony, leaving a
regency, the members of which signed a convention with Moreau,
by which he granted an armistice in return for a heavy contribution
(September 7th, 1796). Immediately afterwards he was
forced to retire.</p>

<p>Between the French and the Austrians, Bavaria was now in
an evil case. Before the death of Charles Theodore (February
16th, 1799) the Austrians had again occupied the country,
preparatory to renewing the war with France. Maximilian IV.
Joseph (of Zweibrücken), the new elector, succeeded to a difficult
inheritance. Though his own sympathies, and those of his all-powerful
minister, Max Josef von Montgelas (<i>q.v.</i>), were, if
anything, French rather than Austrian, the state of the Bavarian
finances, and the fact that the Bavarian troops were scattered
and disorganized, placed him helpless in the hands of Austria;
on the 2nd of December 1800 the Bavarian arms were involved
in the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, and Moreau once more
occupied Munich. By the treaty of Lunéville (February 9th,
1801) Bavaria lost the Palatinate and the duchies of Zweibrücken
and Jülich.</p>

<p>In view of the scarcely disguised ambitions and intrigues of
the Austrian court, Montgelas now believed that the interests of
Bavaria lay in a frank alliance with the French republic;
he succeeded in overcoming the reluctance of
<span class="sidenote">French influence.</span>
Maximilian Joseph; and, on the 24th of August, a
separate treaty of peace and alliance with France was signed at
Paris. By the third article of this the First Consul undertook
to see that the compensation promised under the 7th article
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page549" id="page549"></a>549</span>
of the treaty of Lunéville for the territory ceded on the left bank
of the Rhine, should be carried out at the expense of the Empire
in the manner most agreeable to Bavaria (de Martens, <i>Recueil</i>,
vol. vii. p. 365). In 1803, accordingly, in the territorial rearrangements
consequent on Napoleon&rsquo;s suppression of the
ecclesiastical states, and of many free cities of the Empire,
Bavaria received the bishoprics of Würzburg, Bamberg, Augsburg
and Freisingen, part of that of Passau, the territories of
twelve abbeys, and seventeen cities and villages, the whole
forming a compact territory which more than compensated for
the loss of her outlying provinces on the Rhine.<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Montgelas&rsquo;
ambition was now to raise Bavaria to the rank of a first-rate
power, and he pursued this object during the Napoleonic epoch
with consummate skill, allowing fully for the preponderance of
France&mdash;so long as it lasted&mdash;but never permitting Bavaria to
sink, like so many of the states of the confederation of the
Rhine, into a mere French dependency. In the war of 1805, in
accordance with a treaty of alliance signed at Würzburg on the
23rd of September, Bavarian troops, for the first time since
Charles VII., fought side by side with the French, and by the
treaty of Pressburg, signed on the 26th of December, the principality
of Eichstädt, the margraviate of Burgau, the lordship of
Vorarlberg, the countships of Hohenems and Königsegg-Rothenfels,
the lordships of Argen and Tetnang, and the city of Lindau
with its territory were to be added to Bavaria. On the other
hand Würzburg, obtained in 1803, was to be ceded by Bavaria
to the elector of Salzburg in exchange for Tirol. By the 1st
article of the treaty the emperor acknowledged the assumption
by the elector of the title of king, as Maximilian I.<a name="fa2f" id="fa2f" href="#ft2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The price
which Maximilian had reluctantly to pay for this accession of
dignity was the marriage of his daughter Augusta with Eugène
Beauharnais.</p>

<p>For the internal constitution of Bavaria also the French
alliance had noteworthy consequences. Maximilian himself
was an &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; prince of the 18th-century type, whose
tolerant principles had already grievously offended his clerical
subjects; Montgelas was a firm believer in drastic reform
&ldquo;from above,&rdquo; and, in 1803, had discussed with the rump of
the old estates the question of reforms. But the revolutionary
changes introduced by the constitution proclaimed on the 1st of
May 1808 were due to the direct influence of Napoleon. A clean
sweep was made of the medieval polity surviving in the somnolent
local diets and corporations. In place of the old system of
privileges and exemptions were set equality before the law,
universal liability to taxation, abolition of serfdom, security of
person and property, liberty of conscience and of the press. A
representative assembly was created on paper, based on a narrow
franchise and with very limited powers, but was never summoned.</p>

<p>In 1809 Bavaria was again engaged in war with Austria on
the side of France, and by the treaty signed at Paris on the
28th of February 1810 ceded southern Tirol to Italy and some
small districts to Württemberg, receiving as compensation
parts of Salzburg, the quarters of the Inn and Hausrück and
the principalities of Bayreuth and Regensburg. So far the policy
of Montgelas had been brilliantly successful; but the star of
Napoleon had now reached its zenith, and already the astute
opportunist had noted the signs of the coming change. The
events of 1812 followed; in 1813 Bavaria was summoned to
join the alliance against Napoleon, the demand being passionately
backed by the crown prince Louis and by Marshal Wrede; on
<span class="sidenote">Treaty of Ried.</span>
the 8th of October was signed the treaty of Ried, by
which Bavaria threw in her lot with the Allies. Montgelas
announced to the French ambassador that he
had been compelled temporarily to bow before the storm, adding
&ldquo;Bavaria has need of France.&rdquo; (For Bavaria&rsquo;s share in the
war see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napoleonic Campaigns</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Immediately after the first peace of Paris (1814), Bavaria
ceded to Austria Tirol and Vorarlberg; by the congress of
Vienna it was decided that she was to add to these the greater
part of Salzburg and the quarters of the Inn and Hausrück,
receiving as compensation, besides Würzburg and
<span class="sidenote">Relations with Austria.</span>
Aschaffenburg, the Palatinate on the left bank of the
Rhine and certain districts of Hesse and of the former
abbacy of Fulda. But with the collapse of France the old
fear and jealousy of Austria had revived in full force, and Bavaria
only agreed to these cessions (treaty of Munich, April 16th,
1816) on Austria promising that, in the event of the powers ignoring
her claim to the Baden succession in favour of that of the
line of the counts of Hochberg, she should receive also the
Palatinate on the right bank of the Rhine. The question was
thus left open, the tension between the two powers remained
extreme, and war was only averted by the authority of the
Grand Alliance. At the congress of Aix (1818) the question of
the Baden succession was settled in favour of the Hochberg line,
without the compensation stipulated for in the treaty of Munich;
and by the treaty of Frankfort, signed on behalf of the four great
powers on the 20th of July 1819, the territorial questions at
issue between Bavaria and Austria were settled, in spite of the
protests of the former, in the general sense of the arrangement
made at Vienna. A small strip of territory was added, to connect
Bavaria with the Palatinate, and Bavarian troops were to garrison
the federal fortress of Mainz.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the 1st of February 1817, Montgelas had been
dismissed; and Bavaria had entered on a new era of constitutional
reform. This implied no breach with the European
policy of the fallen minister. In the new German
<span class="sidenote">Constitution of 1818.</span>
confederation Bavaria had assumed the rôle of defender
of the smaller states against the ambitions of
Austria and Prussia, and Montgelas had dreamed of a Bavarian
hegemony in South Germany similar to that of Prussia in the
north. It was to obtain popular support for this policy and for
the Bavarian claims on Baden that the crown prince pressed
for a liberal constitution, the reluctance of Montgelas to concede
it being the cause of his dismissal. On the 26th of May 1818 the
constitution was proclaimed. The parliament was to consist
of two houses; the first comprising the great hereditary landowners,
government officials and nominees of the crown; the
second, elected on a very narrow franchise, representatives
of the small land-owners, the towns and the peasants. By
additional articles the equality of religions was guaranteed
and the rights of Protestants safeguarded, concessions which
were denounced at Rome as a breach of the Concordat, which
had been signed immediately before. The result of the constitutional
experiment hardly justified the royal expectations;
the parliament was hardly opened (February 5th, 1819) before
the doctrinaire radicalism of some of its members, culminating
in the demand that the army should swear allegiance to the
constitution, so alarmed the king, that he appealed to Austria
and Germany, undertaking to carry out any repressive measures
they might recommend. Prussia, however, refused to approve
of any <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i>; the parliament, chastened by the consciousness
that its life depended on the goodwill of the king, moderated
its tone; and Maximilian ruled till his death as a model constitutional
monarch. On the 13th of October 1825, he was
succeeded by his son, Louis I., an enlightened patron of the arts
and sciences, who transferred the university of Landshut to
Munich, which, by his magnificent taste in building, he transformed
into one of the most beautiful cities of the continent.
The earlier years of his reign were marked by a liberal spirit and
the reform, especially, of the financial administration; but the
revolutions of 1831 frightened him into reaction, which was
accentuated by the opposition of the parliament to his expenditure
on building and works of art. In 1837 the Ultramontanes
came into power with Karl von Abel (1788-1859)
as prime minister. The Jesuits now gained the upper hand;
one by one the liberal provisions of the constitution were modified
or annulled; the Protestants were harried and oppressed; and
a rigorous censorship forbade any free discussion of internal
politics. The collapse of this régime was due, not to popular
agitation, but to the resentment of Louis at the clerical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page550" id="page550"></a>550</span>
opposition to the influence of his mistress, Lola Montez. On the
17th of February 1847, Abel was dismissed, for publishing his
<span class="sidenote">Lola Montez.</span>
memorandum against the proposal to naturalize Lola,
who was an Irishwoman; and the Protestant Georg
Ludwig von Maurer (<i>q.v</i>.) took his place. The new
ministry granted the certificate of naturalization; but riots,
in which ultramontane professors of the university took part,
were the result. The professors were deprived, the parliament
dissolved, and, on the 27th of November, the ministry dismissed.
Lola Montez, created Countess Landsfeld, was supreme in the
state; and the new minister, Prince Ludwig von Oettingen-Wallerstein
(1791-1870), in spite of his efforts to enlist Liberal
sympathy by appeals to pan-German patriotism, was powerless
to form a stable government. His cabinet was known as the
&ldquo;Lolaministerium&rdquo;; in February 1848, stimulated by the
news from Paris, riots broke out against the countess; on the
11th of March the king dismissed Oettingen, and on the 20th,
realizing the force of public opinion against him, abdicated in
favour of his son, Maximilian II.</p>

<p>Before his abdication Louis had issued, on the 6th of March, a
proclamation promising the zealous co-operation of the Bavarian
government in the work of German freedom and
unity.  To the spirit of this Maximilian was faithful,
<span class="sidenote">Anti-Prussian policy.</span>
accepting the authority of the central government
at Frankfort, and (19th of December) sanctioning the
official promulgation of the laws passed by the German parliament.
But Prussia was henceforth the enemy, not Austria. In
refusing to agree to the offer of the imperial crown to Frederick
William IV., Maximilian had the support of his parliament.
In withholding his assent to the new German constitution,
by which Austria was excluded from the Confederation, he ran
indeed counter to the sentiment of his people; but by this time
the back of the revolution was broken, and in the events which
led to the humiliation of Prussia at Olmütz in 1851, and the
restoration of the old diet of the Confederation, Bavaria was
safe in casting in her lot with Austria (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Germany</a></span>: <i>History</i>).
The guiding spirit in this anti-Prussian policy, which characterized
Bavarian statesmanship up to the war of 1866, was Ludwig
Karl Heinrich von der Pfordten (1811-1880), who became minister
for foreign affairs on the 19th of April 1849. His idea for the
ultimate solution of the question of the balance of power in
Germany was the so-called <i>Trias</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a league of the Rhenish
states as a counterpoise to the preponderance of Austria and
Prussia. In internal affairs his ministry was characterized by
a reactionary policy less severe than elsewhere in Germany,
which led none the less from 1854 onward to a struggle with the
parliament, which ended in the dismissal of Pfordten&rsquo;s ministry
on the 27th of March 1859. He was succeeded by Karl Freiherr
von Schrenk auf Notzing (1806-1884), an official of Liberal
tendencies who had been Bavarian representative in the diet
of the Confederation. Important reforms were now introduced,
including the separation of the judicial and executive powers
and the drawing up of a new criminal code. In foreign affairs
Schrenk, like his predecessor, aimed at safeguarding the independence
of Bavaria, and supported the idea of superseding
the actual constitution of the Confederation by a supreme
directory, in which Bavaria, as leader of the purely German states,
would hold the balance between Prussia and Austria. Bavaria
accordingly opposed the Prussian proposals for the reorganization
of the Confederation, and one of the last acts of King
Maximilian was to take a conspicuous part in the assembly of
princes summoned to Frankfort in 1863 by the emperor Francis
Joseph (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Germany</a></span>).</p>

<p>Maximilian was succeeded on the 10th of March 1864 by his
son Louis II., a youth of eighteen. The government was at first
carried on by Schrenk and Pfordten in concert. Schrenk soon
retired, when the Bavarian government found it necessary, in
order to maintain its position in the Prussian <i>Zollverein</i>, to
become a party to the Prussian commercial treaty with France,
signed in 1862. In the complicated Schleswig-Holstein question
(<i>q.v</i>.) Bavaria, under Pfordten&rsquo;s guidance, consistently opposed
Prussia, and headed the lesser states in their support of Frederick
of Augustenburg against the policy of the two great German
powers. Finally, in the war of 1866, in spite of Bismarck&rsquo;s
efforts to secure her neutrality, Bavaria sided actively with
Austria.</p>

<p>The rapid victory of the Prussians and the wise moderation
of Bismarck paved the way for a complete revolution in Bavaria&rsquo;s
relation to Prussia and the German question. The
South German Confederation, contemplated by the
<span class="sidenote">Union with German Empire.</span>
6th article of the treaty of Prague, never came into
being; and, though Prussia, in order not prematurely to
excite the alarm of France, opposed the suggestion that the
southern states should join the North German Confederation,
the bonds of Bavaria, as of the other southern states, with the
north, were strengthened by an offensive and defensive alliance
with Prussia, as the result of Napoleon&rsquo;s demand for &ldquo;compensation&rdquo;
in the Palatinate. This was signed at Berlin on the 22nd
of August 1866, on the same day as the signature of the formal
treaty of peace between the two countries. The separatist
ambitions of Bavaria were thus formally given up; she had no
longer &ldquo;need of France&rdquo;; and in the war of 1870-71, the
Bavarian army marched, under the command of the Prussian
crown prince, against the common enemy of Germany. It was
on the proposal of King Louis II. that the imperial crown was
offered to King William.</p>

<p>This was preceded, on the 23rd of November 1870, by the
signature of a treaty between Bavaria and the North German
Confederation. By this instrument, though Bavaria became an
integral part of the new German empire, she reserved a larger
measure of sovereign independence than any of the other constituent
states. Thus she retained a separate diplomatic service,
military administration, and postal, telegraph and railway
systems. The treaty was ratified by the Bavarian chambers
on the 21st of January 1871, though not without considerable
opposition on the part of the so-called &ldquo;patriot&rdquo; party. Their
hostility was increased by the <i>Kulturkampf</i>, due to the promulgation
in 1870 of the dogma of papal infallibility. Munich University,
where Döllinger (<i>q.v</i>.) was professor, became the centre
of the opposition to the new dogma, and the &ldquo;old Catholics&rdquo;
(<i>q.v</i>.) were protected by the king and the government. The
federal law expelling the Jesuits was proclaimed in Bavaria on
the 6th of September 1871 and was extended to the Redemptorists
in 1873. On the 31st of March 1871, moreover, the bonds
with the rest of the empire had been drawn closer by the
acceptance of a number of laws of the North German Confederation,
of which the most important was the new criminal code,
which was finally put into force in Bavaria in 1879. The
opposition of the &ldquo;patriot&rdquo; party, however, reinforced by the
strong Catholic sentiment of the country, continued powerful,
and it was only the steady support given by the king to successive
Liberal ministries that prevented its finding disastrous
expression in the parliament, where it remained in a greater or
less majority till 1887, and has since, as the &ldquo;centre,&rdquo; continued
to form the most compact party in an assembly made up of
&ldquo;groups.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the royal dreamer, whose passion for building palaces
was becoming a serious drain on the treasury, had been declared
insane, and, on the 7th of June 1886, the heir-presumptive,
Prince Luitpold, was proclaimed regent. Six days later, on the
13th of June, Louis committed suicide. His brother, Otto I.,
being also insane, the regency was confirmed to Prince Luitpold.</p>

<p>Since 1871 Bavaria has shared to the full in the marvellous
development of Germany; but her &ldquo;particularism,&rdquo; founded
on traditional racial and religious antagonism to the Prussians,
was by no means dead, though it exhibited itself in no more
dangerous form than the prohibition, reissued in 1900, to display
any but the Bavarian flag on public buildings on the emperor&rsquo;s
birthday; a provision which has been since so far modified as
to allow the Bavarian and imperial flags to be hung side by side.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAWBEE<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (of very doubtful origin, the most plausible conjecture
being that the word is a corruption from the name of
the mint master Sillebawby, by whom they were first issued,
<i>c.</i> 1541), the Scottish name for a halfpenny or other small coin,
and hence used of money generally. A writer in 1573, quoted
in Tytler&rsquo;s <i>History of Scotland</i>, speaks of &ldquo;a coin called a
bawbee, ... which is in value English one penny and a
quarter.&rdquo; The word was sometimes written &ldquo;babie,&rdquo; and has
therefore been identified merely with a &ldquo;baby coin,&rdquo; but this
etymology is less probable.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAXTER, ANDREW<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (1686-1750), Scottish metaphysician,
was born in Aberdeen and educated at King&rsquo;s College. He
maintained himself by acting as tutor to noblemen&rsquo;s sons.
From 1741 to 1747 he lived with Lord Blantyre and Mr Hay of
Drummelzier at Utrecht, and made excursions in Flanders,
France and Germany. Returning to Scotland, he lived at
Whittingehame, near Edinburgh, till his death in 1750. At Spa
he had met John Wilkes, then twenty years of age, and formed
a lasting friendship with him. His chief work, <i>An Inquiry into
the Nature of the Human Soul</i> (editions 1733, 1737 and 1745;
with appendix added in 1750 in answer to an attack in Maclaurin&rsquo;s
Account of Sir I. Newton&rsquo;s Philosophical Discoveries, and
dedication to John Wilkes), examines the properties of matter.
The one essential property of matter is its inactivity, <i>vis inertiae</i>
(accepted later by Monboddo). All movement in matter is,
therefore, caused by some immaterial force, namely, God. But
the movements of the body are not analogous to the movements
of matter; they are caused by a special immaterial force, the
soul. The soul, as being immaterial, is immortal, and its consciousness
does not depend upon its connexion with the body.
The argument is supported by an analysis of the phenomena of
dreams, which are ascribed to direct spiritual influences. Lastly
Baxter attempted to prove that matter is finite. His work is an
attack on Toland&rsquo;s <i>Letters to Serena</i> (1704), which argued that
motion is essential to matter, and on Locke and Berkeley. His
criticism of Berkeley (in the second volume) is, however, based
on the common misinterpretation of his theory (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Berkeley</a></span>).
Sir Leslie Stephen speaks of him as a curious example of &ldquo;the
effects of an exploded metaphysics on a feeble though ingenious
intellect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beside the <i>Inquiry</i>, Baxter wrote <i>Matho sive Cosmotheoria
Puerilis</i> (an exposition in Latin of the elements of astronomy
written for his pupils&mdash;editions in English 1740, 1745 and 1765,
with one dialogue re-written); <i>Evidence of Reason in Proof of
the Immortality of the Soul</i> (published posthumously from MSS.
by Dr Duncan in 1779).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAXTER, RICHARD<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (1615-1691), English puritan divine,
called by Dean Stanley &ldquo;the chief of English Protestant Schoolmen,&rdquo;
was born at Rowton, in Shropshire, at the house of his
maternal grandfather, in November (probably the 12th) 1615.
His ancestors had been gentlefolk, but his father had reduced
himself to hard straits by loose living. About the time of
Richard&rsquo;s birth, however, he changed decisively for the better.
The boy&rsquo;s early education was poor, being mainly in the hands
of the illiterate and dissolute clergy and readers who held the
neighbouring livings at that time. He was better served by
John Owen, master of the free school at Wroxeter, where he
studied from about 1629 to 1632, and made fair progress in
Latin. On Owen&rsquo;s advice he did not proceed to Oxford (a step
which he afterwards regretted), but went to Ludlow Castle to
read with Richard Wickstead, the council&rsquo;s chaplain there.
Wickstead neglected his pupil entirely, but Baxter&rsquo;s eager mind
found abundant nourishment in the great library at the castle.
He was persuaded&mdash;against his will&mdash;to turn his attention to a
court life, and he went to London under the patronage of Sir
Henry Herbert, master of the revels, to follow that course; but
he very soon returned home with a fixed resolve&mdash;confirmed by
the death of his mother&mdash;to study divinity. After three months&rsquo;
schoolmastering for Owen at Wroxeter he read theology, and
especially the schoolmen, with Francis Garbet, the local clergyman.
About this time (1634) he met Joseph Symonds and
Walter Cradock, two famous Nonconformists, whose piety and
fervour influenced him considerably. In 1638 he was nominated
to the mastership of the free grammar school, Dudley, in which
place he commenced his ministry, having been ordained and
licensed by John Thornborough, bishop of Worcester. His
success as a preacher was, at this early period, not very great;
but he was soon transferred to Bridgnorth (Shropshire), where,
as assistant to a Mr Madstard, he established a reputation for
the vigorous discharge of the duties of his office.</p>

<p>He remained at Bridgnorth nearly two years, during which
time he took a special interest in the controversy relating to
Nonconformity and the Church of England. He soon, on some
points, especially matters of discipline, became alienated from
the Church; and after the requirement of what is called &ldquo;the
<i>et cetera</i> oath,&rdquo; he rejected episcopacy in its English form. He
could not, however, be called more than a moderate Nonconformist;
and such he continued to be throughout his life.
Though commonly denominated a Presbyterian, he had no
exclusive attachment to Presbyterianism, and often manifested
a willingness to accept a modified Episcopalianism. All forms
of church government were regarded by him as subservient to
the true purposes of religion.</p>

<p>One of the first measures of the Long Parliament was to effect
the reformation of the clergy; and, with this view, a committee
was appointed to receive complaints against them. Among the
complainants were the inhabitants of Kidderminster, a town
which had become famous for its ignorance and depravity.
This state of matters was so clearly proved that an arrangement
was agreed to on the part of the vicar (Dance), by which he
allowed £60 a year, out of his income £200, to a preacher who
should be chosen by certain trustees. Baxter was invited to
deliver a sermon before the people, and was unanimously elected
as the minister of the place. This happened in April 1641, when
he was twenty-six years of age.</p>

<p>His ministry continued, with very considerable interruptions,
for about nineteen years; and during that time he accomplished
a work of reformation in Kidderminster and the neighbourhood
which is as notable as anything of the kind upon record. Civilized
behaviour succeeded to brutality of manners; and, whereas the
professors of religion had been but small exceptions to the mass,
the unreligious people became the exceptions in their turn.
He formed the ministers in the country around him into an
association for the better fulfilment of the duties of their calling,
uniting them together irrespective of their differences as Presbyterians,
Episcopalians and Independents. The spirit in which
he acted may be judged of from <i>The Reformed Pastor</i>, a book
published in relation to the general ministerial efforts he promoted.
It drives home the sense of clerical responsibility with
extraordinary power. The result of his action is that, to this
day his memory is cherished as that of the true apostle of the
district where he laboured.</p>

<p>The interruptions to which his Kidderminster life was subjected
arose from the condition of things occasioned by the civil war.
Baxter blamed both parties, but Worcestershire was a cavalier
county, and a man in his position was, while the war continued,
exposed to annoyance and danger in a place like Kidderminster.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page552" id="page552"></a>552</span>
He therefore removed to Gloucester, and afterwards (1643-1645)
settled in Coventry, where he preached regularly both to
the garrison and the citizens. After the battle of Naseby he
took the situation of chaplain to Colonel Whalley&rsquo;s regiment,
and continued to hold it till February 1647. During these
stormy years he wrote his <i>Aphorisms of Justification</i>, which on its
appearance in 1649 excited great controversy.</p>

<p>Baxter&rsquo;s connexion with the Parliamentary army was a very
characteristic one. He joined it that he might, if possible,
counteract the growth of the sectaries in that field, and maintain
the cause of constitutional government in opposition to the
republican tendencies of the time. He regretted that he had not
previously accepted an offer of Cromwell to become chaplain to
the Ironsides, being confident in his power of persuasion under
the most difficult circumstances. His success in converting the
soldiery to his views does not seem to have been very great, but
he preserved his own consistency and fidelity in a remarkable
degree. By public disputation and private conference, as well
as by preaching, he enforced his doctrines, both ecclesiastical
and political, and shrank no more from urging what he conceived
to be the truth upon the most powerful officers than he did from
instructing the meanest followers of the camp. Cromwell disliked
his loquacity and shunned his society; but Baxter having
to preach before him after he had assumed the Protectorship,
chose for his subject the old topic of the divisions and distractions
of the church, and in subsequent interviews not only opposed
him about liberty of conscience, but spoke in favour of the
monarchy he had subverted. There is a striking proof of Baxter&rsquo;s
insight into character in his account of what happened under
these circumstances. Of Cromwell he says, &ldquo;I saw that what
he learned must be from himself.&rdquo; It is worthy of notice that
this intercourse with Cromwell occurred when Baxter was
summoned to London to assist in settling &ldquo;the fundamentals of
religion,&rdquo; and made the memorable declaration, in answer to the
objection that what he had proposed as fundamental &ldquo;might be
subscribed by a Papist or Socinian,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;So much the better, and
so much the fitter it is to be the matter of concord.&rdquo; In 1647
he was staying at the home of Lady Rouse of Rouse-Lench, and
there, in much physical weakness, wrote a great part of his
famous work, <i>The Saints&rsquo; Everlasting Rest</i> (1650). On his
recovery he returned to his charge at Kidderminster, where he
also became a prominent political leader, his sensitive conscience
leading him into conflict with almost every one of the contending
parties in state and church. His conduct now, as at all times,
did &ldquo;credit to his conscientiousness rather than to his wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the Restoration in 1660 Baxter, who had helped to bring
about that event, settled in London. He preached there till the
Act of Uniformity took effect in 1662, and was employed in seeking
for such terms of comprehension as would have permitted the
moderate dissenters with whom he acted to have remained in the
Church of England. In this hope he was sadly disappointed.
There was at that time on the part of the rulers of the church no
wish for such comprehension, and their object in the negotiations
that took place was to excuse the breach of faith which their
rejection of all reasonable methods of concession involved. The
chief good that resulted from the Savoy conference was the
production of Baxter&rsquo;s <i>Reformed Liturgy</i>, a work of remarkable
excellence, though it was cast aside without consideration. The
same kind of reputation which Baxter had obtained in the country
he secured in the larger and more important circle of the metropolis.
The power of his preaching was universally felt, and his
capacity for business placed him at the head of his party. He
had been made a king&rsquo;s chaplain, and was offered the bishopric of
Hereford, but he could not accept the offer without virtually
assenting to things as they were. This he could not do, and after
his refusal he was not allowed, even before the passing of the Act
of Uniformity, to be a curate in Kidderminster, though he was
willing to serve that office gratuitously. Bishop Morley even
prohibited him from preaching in the diocese of Worcester.
Baxter, however, found much consolation in his marriage on the
24th of September 1662 with Margaret Charlton, a woman like-minded
with himself. She died in 1681.</p>

<p>From the ejectment of 1662 to the indulgence of 1687, Baxter&rsquo;s
life was constantly disturbed by persecution of one kind or
another. He retired to Acton in Middlesex, for the purpose of
quiet study, and was dragged thence to prison for keeping a
conventicle. The <i>mittimus</i> was pronounced illegal and irregular,
and Baxter procured a <i>habeas corpus</i> in the court of common
pleas. He was taken up for preaching in London after the
licences granted in 1672 were recalled by the king. The meetinghouse
which he had built for himself in Oxendon Street was closed
against him after he had preached there but once. He was, in
1680, seized in his house, and conveyed away at the risk of his
life; and though he was released that he might die at home, his
books and goods were distrained. He was, in 1684, carried three
times to the sessions house, being scarcely able to stand, and
without any apparent cause was made to enter into a bond for
£400 in security for his good behaviour.</p>

<p>But his worst encounter was with the chief justice, Sir George
Jeffreys, in May 1685. He had been committed to the king&rsquo;s
bench prison on the ridiculous charge of libelling the Church in
his <i>Paraphrase on the New Testament</i>, and was tried before
Jeffreys on this accusation. The trial is well known as among the
most brutal perversions of justice which have occurred in England,
though it must be remembered that no authoritative report of the
trial exists. If the partisan account on which tradition is based
is to be accepted, it would appear that Jeffreys himself acted like
an infuriated madman. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jeffreys, Sir George</a></span>.) Baxter
was sentenced to pay 500 marks, to lie in prison till the money was
paid, and to be bound to his good behaviour for seven years. It
was even asserted at the time that Jeffreys proposed he should be
whipped at the cart&rsquo;s tail through London. The old man, for he
was now seventy, remained in prison for eighteen months, when
the government, vainly hoping to win his influence to their side,
remitted the fine and released him.</p>

<p>During the long time of oppression and injury which followed
the ejectment, Baxter was sadly afflicted in body. His whole life
was indeed one continued illness, but in this part of it his pain and
languor had greatly increased. Yet this was the period of his
greatest activity as a writer. He was a most voluminous author,
his separate works, it is said, amounting to 168. They are as
learned as they are elaborate, and as varied in their subjects as
they are faithfully composed. Such treatises as the <i>Christian
Directory</i>, the <i>Methodus Theologiae Christianae</i>, and the <i>Catholic
Theology</i>, might each have occupied the principal part of the life
of an ordinary man. His <i>Breviate of the Life of Mrs Margaret
Baxter</i> records the virtues of his wife, and reveals on the part of
Baxter a tenderness of nature which might otherwise have been
unknown. His editors have contented themselves with re-publishing
his &ldquo;Practical Works,&rdquo; and his ethical, philosophical,
historical and political writings still await a competent editor.</p>

<p>The remainder of Baxter&rsquo;s life, from 1687 onwards, was passed
in peace and honour. He continued to preach and to publish
almost to the end. He was surrounded by attached friends, and
reverenced by the religious world. His saintly behaviour, his
great talents, and his wide influence, added to his extended age,
raised him to a position of unequalled reputation. He helped to
bring about the downfall of James II. and complied with the
Toleration Act under William and Mary. He died in London on
the 8th of December 1691, and his funeral was attended by
churchmen as well as dissenters. A similar tribute of general
esteem was paid to him nearly two centuries later, when a statue
was erected to his memory at Kidderminster in July 1875.</p>

<p>Baxter was possessed by an unconquerable belief in the power
of persuasive argument. He thought every one was amenable to
reason&mdash;bishops and levellers included. And yet he was as far as
possible from being a quarrelsome man. He was at once a man of
fixed belief and large appreciation, so that his dogmatism and his
liberality sometimes came into collision. His popularity as a
preacher was deservedly pre-eminent; but no more diligent
student ever shut himself up with his books. He was singularly
fitted for intellectual debate, but his devotional tendency was
equally strong with his logical aptitude. Some of his writings,
from their metaphysical subtilty, will always puzzle the learned;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page553" id="page553"></a>553</span>
but he could write to the level of the common heart without loss
of dignity or pointedness. His <i>Reasons for the Christian Religion</i>
is still, for its evidential purpose, better than most works of its
kind. His <i>Poor Man&rsquo;s Family Book</i> is a manual that continues
to be worthy of its title. His <i>Saints&rsquo; Everlasting Rest</i> will always
command the grateful admiration of pious readers. It is also
charged with a robust and manly eloquence and a rare and
unsought felicity of language that make it a masterpiece of style.
Perhaps no thinker has exerted so great an influence upon
nonconformity as Baxter has done, and that not in one direction
only, but in every form of development, doctrinal, ecclesiastical
and practical. He is the type of a distinct class of the Christian
ministry&mdash;that class which aspires after scholarly training,
prefers a broad to a sectarian theology, and adheres to rational
methods of religious investigation and appeal. The rational
element in him was very strong. He had a settled hatred of
fanaticism. Even Quakerism he could scarcely endure. Religion
was with him all and in all&mdash;that by which all besides was
measured, and to whose interests all else was subordinated. Isaac
Barrow said that &ldquo;his practical writings were never minded, and
his controversial ones seldom confuted,&rdquo; and John Wilkins, bishop
of Chester, asserted that &ldquo;if he had lived in the primitive time he
had been one of the fathers of the church.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;Our most valuable source is Baxter&rsquo;s autobiography,
called <i>Reliquiae Baxterianae or Mr Richard Baxter&rsquo;s

abridged this work (1702). The abridgment forms the first volume
of the account of the ejected ministers, but whoever refers to it
should also acquaint himself with the reply to the accusations which
had been brought against Baxter, and which will be found in the
second volume of Calamy&rsquo;s Continuation. William Orme&rsquo;s <i>Life and
Times of Richard Baxter</i> appeared in 2 vols. in 1830; it also forms

Sir James Stephen&rsquo;s interesting paper on Baxter, contributed
originally to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, is reprinted in the second volume
of his <i>Essays</i>. More recent estimates of Baxter are those given by

Dean Stanley in his address at the inauguration of the statue to
Baxter at Kidderminster (see <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, xxxii. 385).</p>

privately and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied law and
entered his father&rsquo;s firm of Baxter &amp; Co., solicitors, with which he
was connected till his death. Though studiously attentive to
business, he was enabled, as a member of the Statistical and other
learned societies, to accomplish much useful economic work. His
principal economic writings were <i>The Budget and the Income Tax</i>
(1860), <i>Railway Extension and its Results</i> (1866), <i>The National

<p><span class="bold">BAXTER, WILLIAM<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> (1650-1723), British antiquarian, critic
and grammarian, nephew of Richard Baxter, the divine, was born
at Llanllugan, Montgomeryshire. When he went to Harrow
school, at the age of eighteen, he was unable to read, and could
speak no language except Welsh. His progress must have been
remarkable, since he published his Latin grammar about ten
years afterwards. During the greater part of his life Baxter was
a schoolmaster, and was finally headmaster of the Mercers&rsquo; school,
where he remained till shortly before his death on the 31st of May
1723. He was an accomplished linguist, and his learning was
undoubtedly very great. His published works are: <i>De Analogia</i>
(1679), an advanced Latin grammar; <i>Anacreontis Teii Carmina</i>,
including two odes of Sappho (1695; reprinted in 1710, &ldquo;with
improvements,&rdquo; which he was accused of having borrowed from
the edition of Joshua Barnes); <i>Horace</i> (1701 and subsequent
editions, regarded as remarkable for its abuse of Bentley);
<i>Glossarium Antiquitatum Britannicarum</i> (1719); and <i>Glossarium
Antiquitatum Romanarum</i> (1826). The last two works were
published by the Rev. Moses Williams, the second (which goes no
farther than the letter A) under the title of <i>Reliquiae Baxterianae</i>,
including an autobiographical fragment. Baxter also contributed
to a joint translation of Plutarch&rsquo;s <i>Moralia</i>, and left notes on
Juvenal and Persius.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAY,<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> a homonymous term of which the principal branches are
as follows, (1) The name of the sweet laurel (<i>Laurus nobilis</i>) or
bay tree (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Laurel</a></span>); this word is derived through the O. Fr.
<i>baie</i>, from Lat. <i>baca</i>, berry, the bay bearing a heavy crop of dark
purple berries. The leaves of the bay were woven in garlands to
crown poets, and hence the word is often used figuratively in the
sense of fame and reward. (2) A wide opening or indentation in
a coast line. This may be of the same origin as &ldquo;bay,&rdquo; in the
architectural sense, or from a Latin word which is seen in the place
name Baiae. (3) The name of a colour, of a reddish brown,
principally used of the colour in horses; there are various shades,
light bay, bright bay, &amp;c. This word is derived from the Latin
<i>badius</i>, which is given by Varro (in <i>Nonnius</i>, pp. 80-82) as one of
the colours of horses. The word is also seen in baize (<i>q.v</i>.). (4)
The deep bark of dogs. This word is also seen in the expression
&ldquo;at bay,&rdquo; properly of a hunted animal who at the last turns on
the &ldquo;baying&rdquo; hounds and defends itself. The origin of the word
is the O. Fr. <i>bayer, abayer</i>, Lat. <i>badare</i>, properly to gape, open wide
the mouth. (5) An architectural term (Fr. <i>travée</i>, Ital. <i>compartimento</i>,
Ger. <i>Abteilung</i>) for any division or compartment of
an arcade, roof, &amp;c. Each space from pillar to pillar in a
cathedral, church or other building is called a &ldquo;bay&rdquo; or
&ldquo;severy.&rdquo; This word is also to be referred to <i>bayer</i>, to gape.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;bay-window&rdquo; or &ldquo;bow-window&rdquo; is a window projecting
outwards and forming a recess in the apartment. Bay-windows
may be rectangular, polygonal or semicircular in plan, in the
last case being better known as bow-windows. The bay-window
would seem to have been introduced in the 15th century, but the
earliest examples of importance are those which were built during
the reign of Edward IV. (1461-1483), when it was largely employed
in the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge and in the feudal castles
of the period. Examples are found in the palace at Eltham,
Cowdray Castle in Sussex, Thornbury Castle in Gloucestershire,
and in the George Inn at Glastonbury; one of the finest of a later
date is that of the Banqueting Hall at Hampton Court, some 50
ft. high. In the great entrance halls of ancient mansions the floor
of the last bay of the hall was generally raised two or three steps,
and this portion was reserved for the lord of the manor and his
guests, and was known as the dais. The usual position of the bay-window
is at one end of this dais, and occasionally but rarely at
both ends. The sills of the windows are at a lower level than
those in the hall, and, raised on one or two steps, are seats in the
recess. The recess of the bay-window was generally covered with a
ribbed vault of elaborate design, and the window itself subdivided
by mullions and transoms. In some of the larger windows such
as those at Cowdray and Hampton Court there are no fewer than
five transoms, and this sub-division gave great scale to the design.
The same feature when employed in an upper storey and supported
by corbels or brackets is known as an oriel window. (See also
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dais</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hall</a></span>.)</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAYAMO,<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> an old inland city on the N. slope of the Sierra
Maestra in Santiago province, Cuba. Pop. (1907) 4102. It lies
on a plain by the Bayamo river, in a fertile country, but isolated
from sea and from railway. Its older parts are extraordinarily
irregular. The streets are of all widths, and of all degrees of
crookedness, and run in all directions. Bayamo was the third of
the seven cities founded by Diego Velazquez, and was established
in 1513. During much of the 16th century it was one of the most
important agricultural and commercial settlements of the island.
Its inland situation gave it relative security against the pirates
who then infested West Indian seas, and the misfortunes of
Santiago were the fortunes of Bayamo. Down the river Cauto,
then open to the sea for vessels of 200 tons, and through Manzanillo,
Bayamo drove a thriving contraband trade that made it at
the opening of the 17th century the leading town of Cuba. A
tremendous flood, in 1616, choking the Cauto with trees and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page554" id="page554"></a>554</span>
wrecked vessels, cut it off from direct access to the sea; but
through Manzanillo it continued a great clandestine traffic with
Curaçao, Jamaica, and other foreign islands all through the 17th
and 18th centuries. Bayamo was then surrounded by fine
plantations. It was a rich and turbulent city. In the war of
1868-78 it was an insurgent stronghold; near it was fought one
of the most desperate conflicts of the war, and it was nearly
destroyed by the opposing parties. Bayamo was the birthplace
and the home of Carlos Manuel de Céspedes (1819-1874), first
president of the &ldquo;first&rdquo; Cuban republic, and was also the
birthplace and home of Tomás Estrada Palma (1835-1908), first
president of the present Cuban republic.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAYARD, PIERRE TERRAIL,<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> <span class="sc">Seigneur de</span> (1473-1524),
French soldier, the descendant of a noble family, nearly every
head of which for two centuries past had fallen in battle, was born
at the château Bayard, Dauphiné (near Pontcharra, Isère), about
1473. He served as a page to Charles I., duke of Savoy, until
Charles VIII. of France, attracted by his graceful bearing, placed
him among the royal followers under the seigneur (count) de Ligny
(1487). As a youth he was distinguished for comeliness, affability
of manner, and skill in the tilt-yard. In 1494 he accompanied
Charles VIII. into Italy, and was knighted after the battle of
Fornova (1495), where he had captured a standard. Shortly
afterwards, entering Milan alone in ardent pursuit of the enemy,
he was taken prisoner, but was set free without a ransom by
Lodovico Sforza. In 1502 he was wounded at the assault of
Canossa. Bayard was the hero of a celebrated combat of thirteen
French knights against an equal number of Germans, and his
restless energy and valour were conspicuous throughout the
Italian wars of this period. On one occasion it is said that, single-handed,
he made good the defence of the bridge of the Garigliano
against about 200 Spaniards, an exploit that brought him such
renown that Pope Julius II. sought to entice him into the papal
service, but unsuccessfully. In 1508 he distinguished himself
again at the siege of Genoa by Louis XII., and early in 1509 the
king made him captain of a company of horse and foot. At the
siege of Padua he won further distinction, not only by his valour,
but also by his consummate skill. He continued to serve in the
Italian wars up to the siege of Brescia in 1512. Here his intrepidity
in first mounting the rampart cost him a severe wound,
which obliged his soldiers to carry him into a neighbouring house,
the residence of a nobleman, whose wife and daughters he protected
from threatened insult. Before his wound was healed, he
hurried to join Gaston de Foix, under whom he served in the
terrible battle of Ravenna (1512). In 1513, when Henry VIII. of
England routed the French at the battle of the Spurs (Guinegate,
where Bayard&rsquo;s father had received a lifelong injury in a battle of
1479), Bayard in trying to rally his countrymen found his escape
cut off. Unwilling to surrender, he rode suddenly up to an
English officer who was resting unarmed, and summoned him to
yield; the knight complying, Bayard in turn gave himself up
to his prisoner. He was taken into the English camp, but his
gallantry impressed Henry as it had impressed Lodovico, and the
king released him without ransom, merely exacting his parole not
to serve for six weeks. On the accession of Francis I. in 1515
Bayard was made lieutenant-general of Dauphiné; and after
the victory of Marignan, to which his valour largely contributed,
he had the honour of conferring knighthood on his youthful
sovereign. When war again broke out between Francis I. and
Charles V., Bayard, with 1000 men, held Mézières, which had
been declared untenable, against an army of 35,000, and after
six weeks compelled the imperial generals to raise the siege. This
stubborn resistance saved central France from invasion, as the
king had not then sufficient forces to withstand the imperialists.
All France rang with the achievement, and Francis gained time
to collect the royal army which drove out the invaders (1521).
The parlement thanked Bayard as the saviour of his country;
the king made him a knight of the order of St Michael, and
commander in his own name of 100 <i>gens d&rsquo;armes</i>, an honour till
then reserved for princes of the blood. After allaying a revolt at
Genoa, and striving with the greatest assiduity to check a
pestilence in Dauphiné, Bayard was sent, in 1523, into Italy with
Admiral Bonnivet, who, being defeated at Robecco and wounded
in a combat during his retreat, implored Bayard to assume the
command and save the army. He repulsed the foremost pursuers,
but in guarding the rear at the passage of the Sesia was mortally
wounded by an arquebus ball (April 30th, 1524). He died in the
midst of the enemy, attended by Pescara, the Spanish commander,
and by his old comrade the constable de Bourbon. His
body was restored to his friends and interred at Grenoble.
Chivalry, free of fantastic extravagance, is perfectly mirrored in
the character of Bayard. As a soldier he was one of the most
skilful commanders of the age. He was particularly noted for the
exactitude and completeness of his information of the enemy&rsquo;s
movements; this he obtained both by careful reconnaissance
and by a well-arranged system of espionage. In the midst of
mercenary armies Bayard remained absolutely disinterested, and
to his contemporaries and his successors he was, with his romantic
heroism, piety and magnanimity, the fearless and faultless knight,
<i>le chevalier sans peur et sans reproche</i>. His gaiety and kindness
won him, even more frequently, another name bestowed by his
contemporaries, <i>le bon chevalier</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAYARD, THOMAS FRANCIS<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> (1828-1898), American diplomatist,
was born in Wilmington, Delaware, on the 29th of
October 1828. His great-grandfather, Richard Bassett (1745-1815),
governor of Delaware; his grandfather, James Asheton
Bayard (1767-1815), a prominent Federalist, and one of the
United States commissioners who negotiated the treaty of Ghent
with Great Britain after the War of 1812; his uncle, Richard
Henry Bayard (1796-1868); and his father, James Asheton
Bayard (1799-1880), a well-known constitutional lawyer, all
represented Delaware in the United States Senate. Intending
to go into business, he did not receive a college education; but
in 1848 he began the study of law in the office of his father, and
was admitted to the bar in 1851. Except from 1855 to 1857, when
he was a partner of William Shippen in Philadelphia, he practised
chiefly in Wilmington. He was a United States senator from
Delaware from 1869 to 1885, and in 1881 was (October 10th to
13th) president <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate. His abilities made
him a leader of the Democrats in the Senate, and his views on
financial and legal questions gave him a high reputation for
statesmanship. He was a member of the electoral commission of
1877. In the Democratic national conventions of 1872, 1876,
1880 and 1884 he received votes for nomination as the party
candidate for the presidency. He was secretary of state, 1885-1889,
during the first administration of President Cleveland,
and pursued a conservative policy in foreign affairs, the most
important matter with which he was called upon to deal being
the Bering Sea controversy. As ambassador to Great Britain,
1893-1897, his tall dignified person, unfailing courtesy, and
polished, if somewhat deliberate, eloquence made him a man of
mark in all the best circles. He was considered indeed by many
Americans to have become too partial to English ways; and, for
the expression of some criticisms regarded as unfavourable to
his own countrymen, the House of Representatives went so far
as to pass, on the 7th of November 1895, a vote of censure on
him. The value of Mr Bayard&rsquo;s diplomacy was, however, fully
recognized in the United Kingdom, where he worthily upheld
the traditions of a famous line of American ministers. He was
the first representative of the United States in Great Britain to
hold the diplomatic rank of an ambassador. He died in Dedham,
Massachusetts, on the 28th of September 1898.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAYAZID,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bajazet</span>, a border fortress of Asiatic Turkey,
chief town of a sanjak of the Erzerum vilayet, situated close to
the frontiers of Russia and Persia, and looking across a marshy
plain to the great cone of Ararat, at a general altitude of 6000 ft.
It occupies a site of great antiquity, as the cuneiform inscriptions
on the neighbouring rocks testify; it stands on the site of the
old Armenian town of Pakovan. It is picturesquely situated in
an amphitheatre of sharp, rocky hills. The great trade route
from Trebizond by Erzerum into N.W. Persia crosses the frontier
at Kizil Dize a few miles to the south and does not enter the
town. A knoll above the town is occupied by the half-ruined
fort or palace of former governors, built for Mahmud Pasha by
a Persian architect and considered one of the most beautiful
buildings in Turkey. It contains two churches and a monastery,
the Kasa Kilissa, famous for its antiquity and architectural
grandeur. The cuneiform inscriptions are on the rock pinnacles
above the town, with some rock chambers, indicating a town
or fortress of the Vannic period. The population has lately
decreased and now numbers about 4000. A Russian consul
resides here and the town is a military station. It was captured
during the Russian campaigns of 1828 and 1854, also in 1878,
but was then recaptured by the Turks, who subjected the Russian
garrison to a long siege; the place was ultimately relieved, but
a massacre of Christians then took place in the streets. Bayazid
was restored to Turkey by the treaty of Berlin.</p>

town proper is situated at the mouth of the Pagbañganan river,
45 m. S.S.W. of Tacloban, the provincial capital. A superior
grade of hemp is exported. Other products are rice, corn, copra,

<p><span class="bold">BAY CITY,<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> a city and the county seat of Bay county,
Michigan, U.S.A., on the Saginaw river, about 2 m. from its
entrance into Saginaw Bay and about 108 m. N.N.W. of Detroit.
Pop. (1890) 27,839; (1900) 27,628, of whom 8483 were foreign-born,
including 2413 English-Canadians, 1743 Germans, 1822
Poles&mdash;the city has a Polish weekly newspaper&mdash;and 1075 French-Canadians;
(1910, census) 45,166. Bay City is served by the
Michigan Central, the Père Marquette, the Grand Trunk and
the Detroit &amp; Mackinac railways, and by lake steamers. The
city extends for several miles along both sides of the river, and
is in a good farming district, with which it is connected by stone
roads. Among the public buildings are the Federal building,
the city hall and the public library. The city has lumber and
fishing interests (perch, whitefish, sturgeon, pickerel, bass, &amp;c.
being caught in Saginaw Bay), large machine shops and
foundries (value of products in 1905, $1,743,155, or 31% of
the total of the city&rsquo;s factory products), and various manufactures,
including ships (wooden and steel), wooden ware, wood-pipe,
veneer, railroad machinery, cement, alkali and chicory.
A salt basin underlies the city, and, next to the lumber industry,
the salt industry was the first to be developed, but its importance
has dwindled, the product value in 1905 being $20,098 out of
$5,620,866 for all factory products. Near the city are valuable
coal mines, and there is one within the city limits. At Essexville
(pop. in 1910, 1477), N.E., at Banks, N.W., and at Salzbury,
S.W. of Bay City, are beet-sugar factories&mdash;sugar beets are
extensively grown in the vicinity. Alcohol is made from the
refuse molasses obtained from these beet-sugar factories. The
municipality owns and operates the water-works and electric-lighting
plant. The settlements of Lower Saginaw and Portsmouth
were made in 1837, and were later united to form Bay
City, which was incorporated as a village in 1859, and chartered
as a city in 1865. In 1905 West Bay City (pop. 1900, 13,119)
and Bay City were consolidated.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAYEUX,<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> a town of north-western France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Calvados, 18 m. N.W. of
Caen on the Western railway. Pop. (1906) 6930. Bayeux is
situated on the Aure, 5 m. from the English Channel. Its
majestic cathedral was built in the 13th century on the site of a
Romanesque church, to which the lateral arcades of the nave
and the two western towers with their high stone spires belonged.
A third and still loftier tower, the upper part of which, in the
florid Gothic style, is modern, surmounts the crossing. The
chancel, surrounded with radiating chapels, is a fine example
of early Gothic. Underneath it there is a crypt of the 11th
century restored in the 15th century. The oak stalls in the
choir are fine examples of late 16th-century carving. The former
bishop&rsquo;s palace, parts of which are of great age though the
main building is of the 18th century, serves as law-court and
hôtel de ville. Bayeux possesses many quaint, timbered houses
and stone mansions in its quiet streets. The museum contains
the celebrated Bayeux tapestry (see below). The town is the seat
of a bishop and of a sub-prefect; it has tribunals of first instance
and of commerce, an ecclesiastical seminary, a communal college
and a chamber of arts and manufactures. Dyeing, leather-dressing,
lace-making and the manufacture of porcelain for
household and laboratory purposes are carried on.</p>

<p>Till the 4th century Bayeux bore the name of <i>Augustodurum</i>,
but afterwards, when it became the capital of the two tribes of
the Baiocasses and Viducasses, took the name of Civitas Baiocassium.
Its bishopric dates from the latter half of the 4th
century. Before the Norman invasion it was governed by
counts. Taken in 890 by the Scandinavian chief, Rollo, it was
soon after peopled by the Normans and became a residence of
the dukes of Normandy, one of whom, Richard I., built about
960 a castle which survived till the 18th century. During the
quarrels between the sons of William the Conqueror it was pillaged
and sacked by Henry I. in 1106, and in later times it underwent
siege and capture on several occasions during the Hundred Years&rsquo;
War and the religious wars of the 16th century. Till 1790 it was
the capital of the Bessin, a district of lower Normandy.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAYEUX TAPESTRY, THE<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span>. This venerable relic consists of a
band of linen, 231 ft. long and 20 in. wide, now light brown with
age, on which have been worked with a needle, in worsteds of
eight colours, scenes representing the conquest of England by
the Normans. Of these scenes there are seventy-two, beginning
with Harold&rsquo;s visit to Bosham on his way to Normandy, and
ending with the flight of the English from the battle of Hastings,
though the actual end of the strip has perished. Along the top
and the bottom run decorative borders with figures of animals,
scenes from fables of Aesop and of Phaedrus, from husbandry
and the chase, and occasionally from the story of the Conquest
itself (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Embroidery</a></span>; Plate I. fig. 7). Formerly known as the
<i>Toile de St Jean</i>, it was used on certain feast days to decorate
the nave of Bayeux cathedral. Narrowly escaping the perils of
the Revolution, it was exhibited in Paris, by Napoleon&rsquo;s desire,
in 1803-1804, and has since been in civil custody at Bayeux,
where it is now exhibited under glass. In the Franco-German
War (1871) it was hastily taken down and concealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The noblest monument in the world relating to our old
English history,&rdquo; as William Stukeley described it in 1746, it
has been repeatedly described, discussed and reproduced, both
in France and in England since 1730. The best coloured reproduction
is that by C.A. Stothard in 1818, published in
the sixth volume of <i>Vetusta Monumenta</i>; but in 1871-1872
the &ldquo;tapestry&rdquo; was photographed for the English education
authorities by E. Dossetter.</p>

<p>Local tradition assigned the work to the Conqueror&rsquo;s wife.
F. Pluquet, in his <i>Essai historique sur la ville de Bayeux</i> (Caen,
1829), was the first to reject this belief, and to connect it with the
Conqueror&rsquo;s half-brother Odo, bishop of Bayeux, and this view,
which is now accepted, is confirmed by the fact that three of the
bishop&rsquo;s followers mentioned in Domesday Book are among the
very few named figures on the tapestry. That Odo had it
executed for his cathedral seems tolerably certain, but whether
it was worked by English fingers or not has been disputed,
though some of the words upon it have been held to favour that
view. Freeman emphatically pronounced it to be &ldquo;a contemporary
work,&rdquo; and historically &ldquo;a primary authority ...
in fact the highest authority on the Norman side.&rdquo; As some
of its evidence is unique, the question of its authority is important,
and Freeman&rsquo;s conclusions have been practically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page556" id="page556"></a>556</span>
confirmed by recent discussion. In 1902 M. Marignan questioned,
on archaeological grounds, the date assigned to the tapestry,
as the Abbé de la Rue had questioned it ninety years before;
but his arguments were refuted by Gaston Paris and M. Lanore,
and the authority of the tapestry was vindicated. The famous
relic appears to be the solitary survivor of a class, for Abbot
Baudri described in Latin verse a similar work executed for
Adela, daughter of the Conqueror, and in earlier days the widow
of Brihtnoth had wrought a similar record of her husband&rsquo;s
exploits and death at the hard-fought battle of Maldon (991).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAYEZID I.<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (1347-1403), Ottoman sultan, surnamed <span class="sc">Yilderim</span>
or &ldquo;LIGHTNING,&rdquo; from the great rapidity of his movements,
succeeded his father Murad I. on the latter&rsquo;s assassination on the
field of Kossovo, 1389, and signalized his accession by ordering
at once the execution of his brother Yakub, who had distinguished
himself in the battle. His arms were successful both in Europe
and Asia, and he was the first Ottoman sovereign to be styled
&ldquo;sultan,&rdquo; which title he induced the titular Abbasid caliph to
confer on him. After routing the chivalry of Christendom at the
battle of Nikopoli in 1396, he pursued his victorious career in
Greece, and Constantinople would doubtless have fallen before
his attack, had not the emperor Manuel Palaeologus bought him
off by timely concessions which reduced him practically to the
position of Bayezid&rsquo;s vassal. But his conquests met with a
sudden and overpowering check at the hands of Timur (Tamerlane).
Utterly defeated at Angora by the Mongol invader,
Bayezid became his prisoner, and died in captivity some months
later, in March 1403.</p>

<p>Bayezid first married Devlet Shah Khatun, daughter of the
prince of Kermian, who brought him in dowry Kutaiah and its
dependencies. Two years before his accession he also married a
daughter of the emperor John Palaeologus.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAYEZID II.<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> (1447-1512), sultan of Turkey, was the son of
Mahommed II., whom he succeeded in 1481, but only after
gaining over the janissaries by a large donative, which henceforth
became for centuries the invariable prerogative of that
undisciplined body on the accession of a new sultan. Before he
could establish himself on the throne a long struggle ensued with
his brother Prince Jem. Being routed, Jem fled for refuge to
the knights of St John at Rhodes, who, in spite of a safe-conduct
granted to him, accepted a pension from Bayezid as the price
for keeping him a close prisoner. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aubusson, Pierre d&rsquo;</a></span>.)</p>

<p>So long as Jem lived he was a perpetual menace to the sultan&rsquo;s
peace, and there was considerable rivalry among the sovereigns
of Europe for the possession of so valuable an instrument for
bringing pressure to bear upon the Porte for the purpose of
extracting money or concessions. By common consent the
prince was ultimately entrusted to Pope Innocent VIII., who
used him not only to extract an annual tribute out of the sultan,
but to prevent the execution of Bayezid&rsquo;s ambitious designs in
the Mediterranean. His successor, Alexander VI., used him for
a more questionable purpose, namely, not only to extract the
arrears of the pension due for Jem&rsquo;s safe-keeping, but, by enlarging
on Charles V.&rsquo;s intention of setting him up as sultan, to
persuade Bayezid to aid him against the emperor. There
appears, however, to be no truth in the report that Bayezid
succeeded in bribing the pope to have Jem poisoned. The
prince, who had lived on excellent terms with Alexander, died
at Naples in February 1495, possibly as the result of excesses
in which he had been deliberately encouraged by the pope.</p>

<p>Whether as a result of his fear of the rivalry of Jem, or of
his personal character, Bayezid showed little of the aggressive
spirit of his warlike predecessors; and Machiavelli said that
another such sultan would cause Turkey to cease being a menace
to Europe. He abandoned the attack on Rhodes at the first
check, made concessions, for the sake of peace, to Venice and
reduced the tribute due fiom Ragusa. His wars were of the
nature of raids, on the Dalmatian coast and into Croatia,
Hungary, Moldavia and Poland. The threat of the growing
power in the Aegean of Venice, which had acquired Cyprus in 1489,
at last roused him to a more serious effort; and in 1499 the war
broke out with the republic, which ended in 1502 by the annexation
to Turkey of Lepanto and Modon, Coron and Navarino in
the Morea. Bayezid himself conducted the siege of Modon in 1500.</p>

<p>The comparative inactivity of Bayezid in the direction of
Europe was partly due to preoccupation elsewhere. In the
south he was threatened by the dangerous rivalry of Kait Bey,
the Mameluke sultan of Egypt, who had extended his power
northwards as far as Tarsus and Adana. In 1488 he gained a
great victory over the Ottomans, and in 1491 a peace was made
which was not again broken till after Bayezid&rsquo;s death. On the
side of Persia too, where the decisive battle of Shurur (1502)
had raised to power Ismail, the first of the modern line of shahs,
danger threatened the sultan, and the latter years of his reign
were troubled by the spread, under the influence of the new
Persian power, of the Shi&rsquo;ite doctrine in Kurdistan and Asia
Minor. The forces destined to maintain his authority in Asia
had been entrusted by Bayezid to his three sons, Ahmed, Corcud
and Selim; and the sultan&rsquo;s declining years were embittered
by their revolts and rivalry. Soon after the great earthquake
of 1509, which laid Constantinople in ruins, Selim, the ungovernable
pasha of Trebizond, whose vigorous rule in Asia had given
Europe an earnest of his future career as sultan, appeared before
Adrianople, where Bayezid had sought refuge. The sultan had
designated Ahmed as his successor, but Selim, though temporarily
defeated, succeeded in winning over the janissaries.
On the 25th of April 1512 Bayezid was forced to abdicate in

<p><span class="bold">BAY ISLANDS<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Islas de la Bahía</span>), a small archipelago in
the Caribbean Sea, off the coast of Honduras, of which country
it forms an administrative district. Pop. (1905) about 3000,
including 500 Indians. The archipelago consists of Roatan or
Ruatan, Guanaja or Bonacca, Utilla, Barbareta, Helena, Morat,
the Puercos or Hog Islands, and many <i>cays</i> or islets. The Bay
Islands have a good soil, a fine climate and an advantageous
position. Roatan, the largest, is about 30 m. long by 9 m.
broad, with mountains rising to the height of 900 ft., covered
with valuable woods and abounding with deer and wild hogs.
Its chief towns are Coxen Hole and Puerto Real. Its trade is
chiefly with New Orleans in plantains, cocoa-nuts, pineapples
and other fruit. Guanaja is 9 m. long by 5 m. broad; it lies
15 m. E.N.E. of Roatan. Wild hogs abound in its thickly-wooded
limestone hills. The other islands are comparatively
small, and may, in some cases, be regarded as detached parts of
Roatan, with which they are connected by reefs. Guanaja was
discovered in 1502 by Columbus, but the islands were not
colonized until the 17th century, when they were occupied by
British logwood cutters from Belize, and pearlers from the
Mosquito Coast. Forts were built on Roatan in 1742, but
abandoned in 1749. In 1852 the islands were annexed by Great
Britain. In 1859 they were ceded to Honduras.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAYLE, PIERRE<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> (1647-1706), French philosopher and man
of letters, was born on the 18th of November 1647, at le
Carla-le-Comte, near Pamiers (Ariège). Educated by his father, a
Calvinist minister, and at an academy at Puylaurens, he afterwards
entered a Jesuit college at Toulouse, and became a Roman
Catholic a month later (1669). After seventeen months he
resumed his former religion, and, to avoid persecution, fled to
Geneva, where he became acquainted with Cartesianism. For
some years he acted under the name of Bèle as tutor in various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page557" id="page557"></a>557</span>
Parisian families, but in 1675 he was appointed to the chair
of philosophy at the Protestant university of Sedan. In 1681
the university at Sedan was suppressed, but almost immediately
afterwards Bayle was appointed professor of philosophy and
history at Rotterdam. Here in 1682 he published his famous
<i>Pensées diverses sur la comète de 1680</i> and his critique of Maimbourg&rsquo;s
work on the history of Calvinism. The great reputation
achieved by this critique stirred the envy of Bayle&rsquo;s colleague,
P. Jurieu, who had written a book on the same subject. In 1684
Bayle began the publication of his <i>Nouvelles de la république
des lettres</i>, a kind of journal of literary criticism. In 1690
appeared a work entitled <i>Avis important aux refugiés</i>, which
Jurieu attributed to Bayle, whom he attacked with animosity.
After a long quarrel Bayle was deprived of his chair in 1693.
He was not depressed by this misfortune, especially as he was
at the time closely engaged in the preparation of the <i>Historical
and Critical Dictionary</i> (<i>Dictionnaire historique et critique</i>). The
remaining years of Bayle&rsquo;s life were devoted to miscellaneous
writings, arising in many instances out of criticisms made upon
his <i>Dictionary</i>. He died in exile at Rotterdam on the 28th of
December 1706. In 1906 a statue in his honour was erected at
Pamiers, &ldquo;la réparation d&rsquo;un long oubli.&rdquo; Bayle&rsquo;s erudition,
despite the low estimate placed upon it by Leclerc, seems to have
been very considerable. As a constructive thinker, he did little.
As a critic he was second to none in his own time, and even yet
one can admire the delicacy and the skill with which he handles
his subject. The <i>Nouvelles de la république des lettres</i> (see Louis
P. Betz, <i>P. Bayle und die Nouvelles de la république des lettres</i>,
Zürich, 1896) was the first thorough-going attempt to popularize
literature, and it was eminently successful. The <i>Dictionary</i>,
however, is Bayle&rsquo;s masterpiece.</p>

1797. He was educated at Winchester and at St Mary Hall,
Oxford, with a view to entering the church. While on a visit
to Dublin, however, he discovered his ability to write ballads,
and on his return to England in 1824 he quickly gained a wide
reputation with &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a butterfly,&rdquo; following this up with
&ldquo;We met&mdash;&rsquo;twas in a crowd,&rdquo; &ldquo;She wore a wreath of roses,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, no, we never mention her,&rdquo; and other light and graceful
songs for which his name is still remembered. He set some of
his songs to music himself; a well-known example is &ldquo;Gaily
the troubadour.&rdquo; Bayly also wrote two novels, <i>The Aylmers</i>
and <i>A Legend of Killarney</i>, and numerous plays. His most
successful dramatic piece was <i>Perfection</i>, which was produced
by Madame Vestris and received high praise from Lord Chesterfield.
Bayly had married in 1826 an Irish heiress, but her estates
were mismanaged and the anxiety caused by financial difficulties
undermined his health. He died on the 22nd of April 1839.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAYNES, THOMAS SPENCER<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> (1823-1887), English editor
and man of letters, the son of a Baptist minister, was born at
Wellington, Somerset, on the 24th of March 1823. He studied
at Edinburgh University, where he was a pupil of Sir William
Hamilton, whose assistant he became and of whose views on
logic he became the authorized exponent. This teaching was
embodied in his <i>Essay on the New Analytic of Logical Forms</i>,
published in 1850, the same year in which he took his London
University degree. This was followed in the next year by a
translation of Arnauld&rsquo;s <i>Port Royal Logic</i>. In 1850 he had
become editor of the <i>Edinburgh Guardian</i>, but after four years&rsquo;
work his health gave way. He spent two years in Somerset and
then went to London, becoming, in 1858, assistant editor of the
<i>Daily News</i>. In 1864 he was appointed professor of logic
metaphysics and English literature at the university of St
Andrews, and in 1873 the editorship of the ninth edition of the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> was entrusted to him. He conducted
it singly until 1881, when the decline of his health rendered it
necessary to provide him with a coadjutor in the person of
Prof. W. Robertson Smith. Baynes, however, continued to be
engaged upon the work until his death on the 31st May 1887,
shortly before its completion. His article on Shakespeare
(<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, 9th ed.) was republished in 1894,
along with other essays on Shakespearian topics and a memoir
by Prof. Lewis Campbell.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAYONET,<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> a short thrusting weapon, fixed to the muzzle
or fore-end of a rifle or musket and carried by troops armed with
the latter weapons. The origin of the word is disputed, but
there is some authority for the supposition that the name is
derived from the town of Bayonne, where the short dagger called
<i>bayonnette</i> was first made towards the end of the 15th century.
The elder Puységur, a native of Bayonne, says (in his <i>Memoirs</i>,
published posthumously in Paris, 1747) that when he was
commanding the troops at Ypres in 1647 his musketeers used
bayonets consisting of a steel dagger fixed in a wooden haft,
which fitted into the muzzle of the musket&mdash;in fact plug-bayonets.
Courts-martial were held on some English soldiers at Tangier
in 1663-1664 for using their daggers on their comrades. As
bayonets were at first called daggers, and as there were few or
no pikemen in Tangier until 1675, the probable conclusion is
that the troops in Tangier used plug-bayonets. In 1671 plug-bayonets
were issued to the French regiment of fusiliers then
raised. They were issued to part of an English dragoon regiment
raised in 1672 and disbanded in 1674, and to the Royal Fusiliers
when raised in 1685. The danger incurred by the use of this
bayonet (which put a stop to all fire) was felt so early that the
younger Puységur saw a ring-bayonet in 1678 which could be
fixed without stopping the fire. The English defeat at Killiecrankie
in 1689 was due (among other things) to the use of the
plug-bayonet; and shortly afterwards the defeated leader,
General Mackay, introduced a ring-bayonet of his own invention.
A trial with badly-fitting socket or zigzag bayonets was made
after the battle of Fleurus, 1690, in the presence of Louis XIV.,
who refused to adopt them. Shortly after the peace of Ryswick
(1697) the English and Germans abolished the pike and introduced
these bayonets, and plates of them are given in Surirey
de St Remy&rsquo;s <i>Mémoires d&rsquo;Artillerie</i>, published in Paris in that
year; but owing to a military cabal they were not issued to
the French infantry until 1703. Henceforward the bayonet
became, with the musket or other firearm, the typical weapon of
infantry. This bayonet remained in the British service until
1805, when Sir John Moore introduced a bayonet fastened to
the musket by a spring clip. The triangular bayonet (so called
from the cross-section of its blade) was used in the British army
until the introduction of the magazine rifle, when it was replaced
by the sword-bayonet or dagger-bayonet. Sword-bayonets&mdash;weapons
which could be used as sword or dagger apart from the
rifle&mdash;had long been in use by special troops such as engineers
and rifles, and many ingenious attempts have been made to
produce a bayonet fitted for several uses. A long curved sword-bayonet
with a saw-edged back was formerly used by the Royal
Engineers, but all troops are now supplied with the plain sword-bayonet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page558" id="page558"></a>558</span>
The bayonet is usually hung in a scabbard on the belt
of the soldier and only fixed during the final stages of a battle;
the reason for this is that the &ldquo;jump&rdquo; of the rifle due to the
shock of explosion is materially altered by the extra weight at
the muzzle, which thus deranges the sighting. In the short
Lee-Enfield rifle of 1903, the bayonet, not being directly attached
to the barrel, does not influence accuracy, but with the long
rifles, when the bayonet is fixed, the sight must be raised by
two or three graduations to ensure correct elevation. In the
Russian army troops almost invariably carry the bayonet
(triangular) fixed; the model (1891) of Italian carbine has an
inseparable bayonet; the United States rifle (the new short
model of 1903) has a knife bayonet, the model of 1905, which is
20.5875 in. long, with the lower edge of the blade sharpened along
its entire length and the upper edge sharpened 5 in. from the
point; this bayonet is carried in a wooden and leather scabbard
attached to the cartridge belt. The British bayonet (pattern
1903) has a blade 1 ft. in length. The length of the rifle and
bayonet together, considered as an <i>arme blanche</i>, varies considerably,
that of the French Lebel pattern of 1886 being 6 ft., as
against the 4 ft. 8¾ in. of the British short Lee-Enfield of 1903.
The German rifles (1898) have a length with bayonet of 5 ft. 9¾ in.;
the Russian (1894) 5 ft. 9 in.; and the Japanese 5 ft. 5½ in.
In 1908 a new British bayonet was approved, 5 in. longer than
its predecessor of 1903, the shape of the point being modified
to obtain the thrusting effect of a spear or lance head.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAYONNE,<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> a town of south-western France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Basses-Pyrénées, 66 m.
W.N.W. of Pau on the Southern railway. Pop. (1906) 21,779.
Bayonne, a first-class fortified place, is situated at the confluence
of the Adour and its left-hand tributary, the Nive, about 3 m.
from the sea. The two rivers divide the town into three nearly
equal parts, communicating with each other by bridges. Grand
Bayonne lies on the left bank of the Nive; the two squares
which lie close together at the mouth of that river constitute
the most animated quarter of the town. Petit Bayonne lies
between the right bank of the Nive and the Adour; Saint Esprit,
dominated by a citadel which is one of the finest works of Vauban,
occupies the right bank of the Adour. The last is inhabited
partly by a colony of Jews dating at least from the early 16th
century. To the north-west of the town are the Allées Marines,
fine promenades which border the Adour for a mile and a quarter,
and the Allées Paulmy, skirting the fortifications. The cathedral
of Ste Marie in Grand Bayonne is an imposing Gothic structure
of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. It consists of a choir with
deambulatory and apsidal chapels (the oldest part of the church),
a transept, nave and aisles. The towers at the west end were
only completed during the general restoration which took place
in the latter half of the 19th century. A fine cloister of the 13th
century adjoins the south side of the church. Ste Marie contains
glass windows of the 15th and 16th centuries and other rich
decoration. The Vieux-Château, also in Grand Bayonne, dates
from the 12th and 15th centuries and is built upon a portion of
the old Roman fortifications; it is used for military purposes.
The Château Neuf (15th and 16th centuries) serves as barracks
and prison. Bayonne is the seat of a bishopric and of a sub-prefect;
it has tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a
chamber of commerce, a lycée, a school of music, a library, an
art museum with a large collection of the works of the painter
Léon Bonnat, and a branch of the Bank of France. There are
consulates of the chief nations of Europe, of the United States
of America and of several Central and South American republics.
The town also possesses an important military arsenal and
military hospital. The commerce of Bayonne is much more
important than its industries, which include the manufacture
of leather and of chocolate. The port consists of an outer
harbour, the so-called &ldquo;rade&rdquo; (roadstead) and the port proper,
and occupies the course of the Adour from its mouth, which is
obstructed by a shifting bar, to the Pont St Esprit, and the
course of the Nive as far as the Pont Mayou. Above these two
bridges the rivers are accessible only to river navigation. Vessels
drawing from 16 to 22 ft. can make the port in normal weather.
In the five years 1901-1905 the average value of the imports was
£502,000, of the exports £572,000; for the five years 1896-1900
the average value of imports was £637,000, of exports £634,000.
Exports include timber, mine-props, turpentine, resinous
material from the Pyrénées and Landes and zinc ore; leading
imports are the coal and Spanish minerals which supply the
large metallurgical works of Le Boucau at the mouth of the river,
the raw material necessary for the chemical works of the same
town, wine, and the cereals destined for the flour mills of Pau,
Peyrehorade and Orthez. During the early years of the 20th
century the shipping of the port increased considerably in
tonnage. In 1900 there entered 741 vessels, tonnage 277,959; and
cleared 743, tonnage 276,992. In 1907 there entered 661 vessels,
tonnage, 336,773; cleared 650, tonnage 335,849.</p>

<p>In the 3rd century Bayonne (<i>Lapurdum</i>) was a Roman military
post and the principal port of Novempopulana. In the middle
ages it belonged to the dukes of Aquitaine and then to the kings
of England, one of whom, John, granted it full communal rights
in 1216. In 1451 it offered a strenuous opposition to the French,
by whom it was eventually occupied. By this time its maritime
commerce had suffered disaster owing to the silting up of its
port and the deflection of the Adour. New fortifications were
constructed under Louis XII. and Francis I., and in 1523 the
town was able to hold out against a Spanish army. In 1565 it
was the scene of an interview between Charles IX. and Catherine
de&rsquo; Medici on the one hand and Elizabeth, queen of Spain, and
the duke of Alva on the other. It is thought that on this occasion
the plans were formed for the massacres of St Bartholomew, a
crime in which Bayonne took no part, in 1572. In 1808 Napoleon
met Charles IV., king of Spain, and his son Ferdinand at the
Château de Marrac, near the town, and induced them to renounce
their rights to the crown of Spain, which fell to Napoleon&rsquo;s
brother Joseph. In 1814, after a severe siege, Bayonne was
occupied by the English (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peninsular War</a></span>).</p>

adjoining the south boundary of Jersey City, from which it is partly
separated by the Morris Canal. It is separated from Staten
Island only by the narrow strip of water known as the Kill van
Kull, and it has a total water frontage of about 10 m. Pop.
(1890) 19,033; (1900) 32,722, of whom 10,786 were foreign-born
(3168 Irish, 1868 Russian, 1656 German); (1910)
55,545. Land area about 4 sq. m. Bayonne is served by
the Central of New Jersey and by the Lehigh Valley railways
(the latter for freight only), and by electric railway lines
to Newark and Jersey City. The principal public buildings
are the city hall, the public library, the post-office and the city
hospital. Besides having a considerable share in the commerce
of the port of New York, Bayonne is an important manufacturing
centre; among its manufactures are refined petroleum, refined
copper and nickel (not from the ore), refined borax, foundry and
machine-shop products, tubular boilers, electric launches and
electric motors, chemicals (including ammonia and sulphuric
and nitric acids), iron and brass products, wire cables and silk
goods. In 1905 the value of its factory product was $60,633,761,
an increase of 57.1% over that of 1900, Bayonne ranking third
in 1905 among the manufacturing cities of the state. It is the
principal petroleum-distributing centre on the Atlantic seaboard,
the enormous refineries and storehouses of the Standard Oil
Company, among the largest in the world, being located here;
there are connecting pipe lines with the Ohio and Pennsylvania
oil fields, and with New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia and
Washington. Much coal is shipped from the city. Bayonne,
which comprises several former villages (Bayonne, Bergen Point,
Pamrapo and Centerville), was settled about 1665-1670 by the
Dutch. Originally a part of Bergen, it was set off as a township
in 1861. It was chartered as a city in 1869.</p>

abandoned its old channel in the lower stages of its course.
Good examples are found in Palmyra Lake, in the Mississippi
valley below Vicksburg, and in Osage river, Missouri. As a river
swings from side to side in a series of curves which widen laterally
where the current is slow and the country more or less level,
there is a tendency in flood times for the water to impinge more
strongly upon the convex bank where the curve leaves the main
channel. This bank will be eaten away, and the process will be
repeated until the base of the &ldquo;isthmus&rdquo; is cut through, and the
descending channel meets the returning curve, which is thus
left stranded and filled with dead water, while the stream runs
directly past it in the shorter course cut by the flood waters that
deepen the new channel, and leave an isolated ox-bow lake in
the old curve.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAYREUTH,<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Baireuth</span>, a town of Bavaria, Germany,
district of Upper Franconia, 58 m. by rail N.N.E. from Nuremberg.
Pop. (1900) 29,384. In Richard-Wagner-strasse is
Wagner&rsquo;s house, with his grave in the garden. Franz Liszt
(1811-1886) is buried here, as well as Jean Paul Friedrich
Richter, who is commemorated by a monument (1841). His
house was in Friedrichstrasse. Most of the buildings are of
comparatively modern date, the city having suffered severely
from the Hussites in 1430 and from a conflagration in 1621.
There should be mentioned the palace of Duke Alexander of
Württemberg, the administrative offices, the statue of King
Maximilian II. (1860) and the collections of the historical society
Among the ecclesiastical buildings, the <i>Stadt-Pfarrkirche</i>,
dating from 1439, and containing the monuments of the margraves
of Bayreuth, is the most important. Bayreuth is a
railway junction and has an active trade, chiefly in grain and
horses. It manufactures woollen, linen and cotton goods,
leather, delft and other earthenware, and tobacco, and has also
several breweries and distilleries. The village of St Georgen is a
suburb to the north east noted for its marble works; and about
2 m. to the east is the Hermitage, a fanciful building, erected in
1715 by the margrave George William (d. 1726), with gardens
containing terraces, statues and fountains. Bayreuth was
formerly the capital of a principality of the same name, which
was annexed in 1791 to the kingdom of Prussia. In 1807 it
was ceded by Prussia to France, which kept possession of it
till 1810, when it was transferred to Bavaria.</p>

<p><i>The Wagner Theatre.</i>&mdash;Among the many advantages which
Wagner gained from his intimacy with Ludwig II., king of
Bavaria, not the least was the practical support given to his
plan of erecting a theatre for the ideal performance of his own
music-dramas. The first plan of building a new theatre for the
purpose in Munich itself was rejected, because Wagner rightly
felt that the appeal of his advanced works, like the Nibelungen
trilogy, would be far stronger if the comparatively small number
of people who wished to hear them were removed from the distractions
of a large capital; Bayreuth possessed the desired
seclusion, being on a line of railway that could not be approached
from any quarter without changing. The municipality furthered
Wagner&rsquo;s scheme in every way, and in May 1872 the foundation
stone of the Festspielhaus was laid, the event being commemorated
by a notable performance of Beethoven&rsquo;s Choral
Symphony in the old opera-house. The funds for the erection
of the theatre were raised in part by the issue of 1000 certificates
of patronage (<i>Patronatscheine</i>), but the bulk of the sum was
raised by founding &ldquo;Wagner Societies&rdquo; from St Petersburg
to Cairo, from London to New York; these societies sprang
up with such success that the theatre was opened in the summer
of 1876 with the first complete performance of <i>Der Ring des
Nibelungen</i>. The theatre, which stands on a height a little
under a mile from the town, is built from the plans of Gustav
Semper, the idea of the design being Wagner&rsquo;s own, an experiment
indeed, but one which succeeded beyond all expectation.
The seats are arranged on a kind of sloping wedge, in such
a manner that every one has an almost equally good view of
the stage, for there are no boxes, and the only galleries are quite
at the back, one, the <i>Fürstenloge</i>, being reserved for distinguished
guests, the other, above it, for the townspeople. Immediately
in front of the foremost row of seats a hood or sloping screen
of wood covers a part of the orchestra, and another hood of
similar shape starts from the front of the stage at a slightly
lower level. Thus there is left a space between the two hoods
through which the sound of the orchestra ascends with wonderfully
blended effect; the conductor, sitting at the highest point
of the orchestra, though under the screen, has a complete view
of the stage as well as of his instrumentalists, and the sound of
the orchestra is sent most forcibly in the direction of the stage,
so that the voices are always well supported.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As an important addition to the work of the theatre, a permanent
school has been established at Bayreuth for the sake of training
young musicians to take part in the festival performances, which
were at first exclusively, and then partially, undertaken by artists
from other German and foreign theatres. The special feature upon
which most stress has been laid, ever since Wagner&rsquo;s death in 1883,
has been not so much the musical as the dramatic significance of
the works; it is contended by the inmost circle of Wagnerian
adherents that none but they can fully realize the master&rsquo;s intentions

is set forth in much detail from this point of view by Houston Stewart
Chamberlain, in his <i>Richard Wagner</i> (1897 and 1900).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAZA,<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> a town of southern Spain, in the province of Granada;
in the Hoya de Baza, a fruitful valley of the Sierra Nevada, not
far from the small river Gallego, and at the terminus of a railway
from Lorca. Pop. (1900) 12,770. The dome-shaped mountain
of Javaleon (4715 ft.) overlooks the town from the north-west.
The ancient collegiate church of San Maximo occupies the traditional
site of a cathedral founded by the Visigothic king Reccared
about 600, and afterwards converted into a mosque. There is
a brisk local trade in farm produce, and in the linen, hempen
goods and pottery manufactured in Baza. The town nearly
doubled its population in the last quarter of the 10th century.
Sulphurous springs exist in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Baza is the Roman <i>Basti</i>, the medieval <i>Basta</i> or <i>Bastiana</i>;
and numerous relics of antiquity, both Roman and medieval,
have been found in the neighbourhood. Its bishopric was
founded in 306. Under Moorish rule (<i>c.</i> 713-1489) it was one of
the three most important cities in the kingdom of Granada,
with an extensive trade, and a population estimated at 50,000.
In 1489, after a stubborn defence lasting seven months, it was
captured by the Spaniards under Isabella of Castile, whose
cannon still adorn the <i>Alameda</i> or public promenade. On the
10th of August 1810 the French under Marshal Soult defeated a
large Spanish force close to the town.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAZAAR<a name="ar145" id="ar145"></a></span> (Pers. <i>bazar</i>, market), a permanent market or
street of shops, or a group of short narrow streets of stalls under
one roof. The word has spread westward into Arabic, Turkish
and, in special senses, into European languages, and eastward
it has invaded India, where it has been generally adopted. In
southern India and Ceylon bazaar means a single shop or stall.
The word seems to have early reached South Europe (probably
through Turkish), for F. Balducci Pegolotti in his mercantile
handbook (<i>c.</i> 1340) gives &ldquo;bazarra&rdquo; as a Genoese word for
market-place. The Malayan peoples have adopted the word as
<i>pazar</i>. The meaning of the word has been much extended in
English, where it is now equivalent to any sale, for charitable
or mere commercial purposes, of mixed goods and fancy work.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAZAINE, ACHILLE FRANÇOIS<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (1811-1888), marshal of
France, was born at Versailles on the 13th of February 1811.
He entered the army as a private soldier in 1831, with a view to
service in Algeria, and received a commission as sub-lieutenant
in 1833. By his gallantry in action he won the cross of the
Legion of Honour, and he was promoted lieutenant in 1835.
He served two campaigns with the Foreign Legion against the
Carlists in Spain in 1837-38, returning to Africa as captain in
1839. During the succeeding decade he saw continual active
service in Africa, and rose to be a brigadier-general with the
charge of the district of Tlemçen. In the Crimean War he commanded
a brigade, and maintained his reputation in the trenches
before Sevastopol. On the capture of the south side he was
appointed governor of the place, and was promoted general of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page560" id="page560"></a>560</span>
division. He also commanded the French forces in the expedition
to Kinburn. In Lombardy in 1859 he was wounded when in command
of a division at Melegnano, and took a conspicuous part in
the battle of Solferino. For his services in the campaign he
received the grand cross of the Legion of Honour, of which
he was already (1855) a commander. He commanded with
great distinction the first division under General (afterwards
marshal) Forey in the Mexican expedition in 1862, succeeded
him in supreme command in 1863, and became marshal and
senator of France in the following year. He at first pursued the
war with great vigour and success, entering Mexico in 1863 and
driving President Juarez to the frontier. The marshal&rsquo;s African
experience as a soldier and as an administrator stood him in
good stead in dealing with the guerrilleros of the Juarez party,
but he was less successful in his relations with Maximilian, with
whose court the French headquarters was in constant strife.
Here, as later in his own country, Bazaine&rsquo;s policy seems to have
been directed, at least in part, to his own establishment in the
rôle of a mayor of the palace. His own army thought that he
aspired to play the part of a Bernadotte. His marriage to a rich
Mexican lady, whose family were supporters of Juarez, still
further complicated his relations with the unfortunate emperor,
and when at the close of the American Civil War the United
States sent a powerful war-trained army to the Mexican frontier,
the French forces were withdrawn (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mexico</a></span>, <i>History</i>).
Bazaine skilfully conducted the retreat and embarkation at Vera
Cruz (1867). On his return to Paris he was but coldly received
by his sovereign; public opinion was, however, in his favour,
and he was held to have been made a scapegoat for the faults of
others.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Franco-German War (<i>q.v.</i>) Marshal
Bazaine was placed in command of the III. corps of the Army
of the Rhine. He took no part in the earlier battles, but
Napoleon III. soon handed over the chief command of the army
to him. How far his inaction was the cause of the disaster of
Spicheren is a matter of dispute. The best that can be said of his
conduct is that the evil traditions of warfare on a small scale
and the mania for taking up &ldquo;strong positions,&rdquo; common to the
French generals of 1870, were in Bazaine&rsquo;s own case emphasized
by his personal dislike for the &ldquo;schoolmaster&rdquo; Frossard, lately
the Prince Imperial&rsquo;s tutor and now commander of the army
corps posted at Spicheren. Frossard himself, the leader of the
&ldquo;strong positions&rdquo; school, could only blame his own theories
for the paralysis of the rest of the army, which left the corps at
Spicheren to fight unsupported. Bazaine, indeed, when called
upon for help, moved part of his corps forward, but only to &ldquo;take
up strong positions,&rdquo; not to strike a blow on the battlefield.
A few days later he took up the chief command, and his tenure of
it is the central act in the tragedy of 1870. He found the army
in retreat, ill-equipped and numerically at a great disadvantage,
and the generals and staffs discouraged and distrustful of one
another. There was practically no chance of success. The
question was one of extricating the army and the government
from a disastrous adventure, and Bazaine&rsquo;s solution of it was
to bring back his army to Metz. For the events which led up
to the battles before Metz and the investment of Bazaine&rsquo;s
whole army in the fortress, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Franco-german War</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Metz</a></span>,
<i>Battles</i>.</p>

<p>It seems to be clearly established that the charges of treason
to which later events gave so strong a colour had, as yet, no
foundation in fact. Nor, indeed, can his unwillingness to leave
the Moselle region, while there was yet time to slip past the
advancing enemy, be considered even as proof of special
incompetence. The resolution to stay in the neighbourhood of Metz
was based on the knowledge that if the slow-moving French
army ventured far out it would infallibly be headed off and
brought to battle in the open by superior numbers. In &ldquo;strong
positions&rdquo; close to his stronghold, however, Bazaine hoped that
he could inflict damaging repulses and heavy slaughter on the
ardent Germans, and in the main the result justified the
expectation. The scheme was creditable, and even heroic, but the
execution throughout all ranks, from the marshal to the battalion
commanders, fell far short of the idea. The minutely cautious
methods of movement, which Algerian experience had evolved
suitable enough for small African desert columns, which were
liable to surprise rushes and ambushes, reduced the mobility
of a large army, which had favourable marching conditions,
to 5 m. a day as against the enemy&rsquo;s rate of 15. When, before
he had finally decided to stay in Metz, Bazaine attempted
half-heartedly to begin a retreat on Verdun, the staff work and
organization of the movement over the Moselle was so ineffective
that when the German staff calculated that Bazaine was nearing
Verdun, the French had in reality barely got their artillery
and baggage trains through the town of Metz. Even on the
battlefield the marshal forbade the general staff to appear, and
conducted the fighting by means of his personal orderly officers.
After the cumbrous army had passed through Metz it encountered
an isolated corps of the enemy, which was commanded by the
brilliant leader Constantin von Alvensleben, and promptly
attacked the French. At almost every moment of the day
victory was in Bazaine&rsquo;s hands. Two corps of the Germans
fought all day for bare existence. But Bazaine had no confidence
in his generals or his troops, and contented himself
with inflicting severe losses on the most aggressive portions of
the German army. Two days later, while the French actually
retreated on Metz&mdash;taking seven hours to cover 5 to 6 m.&mdash;the
masses of the Germans gathered in front of him, intercepting his
communication with the interior of France. This Bazaine
expected, and feeling certain that the Germans would sooner or
later attack him in his chosen position, he made no attempt to
interfere with their concentration. The great battle was fought,
and having inflicted severe punishment on his assailants, Bazaine
fell back within the entrenched camp of Metz. But although he
made no appeals for help, public opinion, alarmed and excited,
condemned the only remaining army of France, Marshal MacMahon&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Army of Châlons,&rdquo; to rescue Bazaine at all costs. The adventure
ended at Sedan, and with Sedan the Third Empire collapsed.</p>

<p>Up to this point Bazaine had served his country perhaps as
well as circumstances allowed, and certainly with enough skill
and a sufficient measure of success to justify his appointment.
His experience, wide as it was, had not fitted him for the
command of a large army in a delicate position. Since his Mexican
expedition, moreover, he had himself fallen into a state of moral
and physical lethargy, which, imperceptible on the field of battle,
because his reputation for impassive bearing under fire was
beyond question, was only too obvious in the staff offices, where
the work of manoeuvring the army and framing plans and orders
was chiefly done. But, in spite of these defects, it cannot be
asserted that any one of Bazaine&rsquo;s subordinates would have done
better, with the possible exception of Ladmirault, and Ladmirault
was one of the junior corps commanders.</p>

<p>Bazaine, therefore, in the main justified his reputation for
ability. He was now to justify his reputation for intriguing and
underhand diplomacy. If in Mexico he aspired to the rôle of
mayor of the palace, it was far more so in Metz, where, as
commander of the only organized army of France, he conceived
himself to be the ruler of the country&rsquo;s destiny. Accordingly
he engaged in a series of diplomatic intrigues, some of which to
this day have never been properly cleared up. Negotiations
passed between the outer world and the besieged commander,
the purport of which remains still to some extent obscure, but
it is beyond question that he proposed with the permission of
the Germans to employ his army in &ldquo;saving France from herself.&rdquo;
The scheme, however, collapsed, and the army of the Rhine
became prisoners of war to the number of 140,000. At the
moment of the surrender a week&rsquo;s further resistance would have
enabled the levies of the National Defence government to crush
the weak forces of the Germans on the Loire and to relieve Paris.
But the army of Prince Frederick Charles, set free by the
surrender, hurried up in time to check and to defeat the great
effort at Orleans (<i>q.v.</i>). The responsibility for this crushing
blow was naturally enough, and justly enough, placed on Bazaine&rsquo;s
shoulders, and although, when he returned from captivity, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page561" id="page561"></a>561</span>
marshal enjoyed a brief immunity, he was in 1873 brought to
trial before a military court. He was found guilty of negotiating
with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was
prescribed by duty and honour, and sentenced to degradation and
death, but very strongly recommended to mercy. His sentence
was commuted to twenty years&rsquo; seclusion, and the humiliating
ceremonies attending degradation were dispensed with. He
was incarcerated in the Ile Sainte-Marguérite and treated rather
as an exile than as a convict; thence he escaped in 1874 to Italy.
He finally took up his abode in Madrid, where he was treated
with marked respect by the government of Alfonso XII. He
died there on the 23rd of September 1888. He published
<i>Épisodes de la guerre de 1870</i> (Madrid, 1883). He also wrote
<i>L&rsquo;Armée du Rhin</i> (Paris, 1872).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAZALGETTE, SIR JOSEPH WILLIAM<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> (1819-1891), English
engineer, was born at Enfield on the 28th of March 1819. At the
age of seventeen he was articled to an engineer, and a few years
later he began to practise successfully on his own account. His
name is best known for the engineering works he carried out in
London, especially for the construction of the main drainage
system and the Thames embankment. In 1848 the control of
London drainage, which had hitherto been divided among eight
distinct municipal bodies, was consolidated under twelve commissioners,
who were in 1849 superseded by a second commission.
Under the latter Bazalgette accepted an appointment which he
continued to hold under the three successive commissions which
in the course of a year or two followed the second one, and when
finally in 1855 these bodies were replaced by the Metropolitan
Board of Works, he was at once appointed its chief engineer.
His plans were ready, but the work was delayed by official
obstruction and formality until 1858. Once begun, however, it
was vigorously pushed on, and in 1865 the system was formally
opened. It consisted of 83 m. of large intercepting sewers,
draining more than 100 sq. m. of buildings, and calculated to deal
with 420 million gallons a day. The cost was £4,600,000.
Almost simultaneously Bazalgette was engaged on the plans for
the Thames embankment. The section between Westminster
and Vauxhall on the Surrey side was built between 1860 and 1869,
and the length between Westminster and Blackfriars was
declared open by the prince of Wales in 1870. The Chelsea
embankment followed in 1871-1874, and in 1876 Northumberland
Avenue was formed. The total outlay on the scheme exceeded
£2,000,000. Bazalgette was also responsible for various other
engineering works in the metropolitan area, designing, for
example, new bridges at Putney and Battersea, and the steam
ferry between north and south Woolwich. He also prepared
plans for a bridge over the river near the Tower and for a tunnel
under it at Blackwall, but did not live to see either of these
projects carried out. He died on the 15th of March 1891 at
Wimbledon.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BAZARD, AMAND<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> (1791-1832), French socialist, the founder
of a secret society in France corresponding to the Carbonari
of Italy, was born at Paris. He took part in the defence of
Paris in 1815, and afterwards occupied a subordinate situation
in the prefecture of the Seine. About 1820 he united some
patriotic friends into a society, called <i>Amis de la vérité</i>. From this was developed a complete system of Carbonarism, the
peculiar principles of which were introduced from Italy by two
of Bazard&rsquo;s friends. Bazard himself was at the head of the
central body, and, while taking a general lead, contributed
extensively to the Carbonarist journal, <i>L&rsquo;Aristarque</i>. An
unsuccessful outbreak at Belfort ruined the society, and the
leaders were compelled to conceal themselves. Bazard, after
remaining for some time in obscurity in Paris, came to the conclusion
that the ends of those who wished well to the people
would be most easily attained, not through political agitation,
but by effecting a radical change in their social condition. This
train of thinking naturally drew him towards the socialist
philosophers of the school of Saint-Simon, whom he joined. He
contributed to their journal, <i>Le Producteur</i>; and in 1828 began
to give public lectures on the principles of the school (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Saint-Simon</a></span>).
His opposition to the emancipation of women brought
about a quarrel with Enfantin (<i>q.v.</i>) in 1831, and Bazard found
himself almost deserted by the members of the society. He
attacked Enfantin violently, and in a warm discussion between
them he was struck down by apoplexy. After lingering for a
few months he died on the 29th of July 1832.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAZAS<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span>, a town of south-western France, in the department

town, 2505; commune, 4684. The town, which was the seat
of a bishop from at least the beginning of the 6th century
till 1790, has a Gothic church (formerly the cathedral) dating
from the 13th to the 16th centuries. There are remains of
ramparts (15th and 16th centuries) and several old houses
of the 16th century. The vineyards of the vicinity produce
white wine. The town is capital of an arrondissement, and
carries on tanning, &amp;c., and trade in the well-known Bazadais
cattle.</p>

<p>Bazas (<i>Cossio</i>) was capital of the ancient tribe of the
<i>Vasates</i>, and under the Romans one of the twelve cities of Novempopuluna.
In later times it was capital of the district of Bazadais.
It was the scene of much bloodshed during the religious wars
of the 16th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BAZIN, RENÉ<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> (1853-&emsp;&emsp;), French novelist and man of
letters, was born at Angers on the 26th of December 1853. He
studied law in Paris, and on his return to Angers became professor
of law in the Catholic university there. He contributed
to Parisian journals a series of sketches of provincial life and
descriptions of travel, but he made his reputation by <i>Une Tache
d&rsquo;encre</i> (1888), which received a prize from the Academy. Other
novels of great charm and delicacy followed: <i>La Sarcelle bleue</i>
(1892); <i>Madame Corentine</i> (1893); <i>Humble Amour</i> (1894);
<i>De toute son âme</i> (1897); <i>La Terre qui meurt</i> (1899); <i>Les Oberlé</i>

following year; <i>L&rsquo;Âme alsacienne</i> (1903); <i>Donatienne</i> (1903);
<i>L&rsquo;Isolée</i> (1905); <i>Le Blé qui lève</i> (1907); <i>Mémoires d&rsquo;une vieille
fille</i> (1908). <i>La Terre qui meurt</i>, a picture of the decay of peasant
farming and a story of La Vendée, is an indirect plea for the
development of provincial France. A volume of <i>Questions
littéraires et sociales</i> appeared in 1906. René Bazin was admitted

in favour of the deposition of the king. In the Convention he sat
with the Mountain, opposed adjourning the trial of Louis XVI.,
and voted for his death. He joined in the attack upon the
Girondists, but, as member of the committee of general security,
he condemned the system of the Terror. He was implicated by
François Chabot in the falsification of a decree relative to the East
India Company, and though his share seems to have been simply
that he did not reveal the plot, of which he knew but part, he was
accused before the Revolutionary Tribunal at the same time as
Danton and Camille Desmoulins, and was executed on the 5th

<p><span class="bold">BEACH,<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> a word of unknown origin; probably an old dialect
word meaning shingle, hence, by transference, the place covered
by shingle. Beach sometimes denotes the material thrown up by
the waves, sometimes the long resulting ridge, but more frequently
the area between high and low water, or even the area between
land and sea covered with material thrown up by exceptional
storms.</p>

<p>The actual character of beach material depends upon the
nature and structure of the rocks inshore, the strength and
direction of currents, and the force of the waves. The southern
shore of the Isle of Wight furnishes a good example. The island
ends westward in the well-known &ldquo;Needles,&rdquo; consisting of chalk
with flints. The disintegration of this rock by wave action
separates the finer chalk, which is carried seawards in suspension,
from the hard flint, which is piled in rough shingle upon the shore.
The currents sweep constantly eastward up channel, and the
rough flint shingle is rolled along by wave action toward the
Ventnor rampart, and ground finer and finer until it arrives as a
very fine flinty gravel at Ventnor pier. The sweep of Sandown
Bay follows, where the cliffs are composed for the most part of
greensand, and here the beach at low water is sandy and smooth.
The eastern end of the island is again composed of chalk with
flints, and here the beach material as at the western end consists
of very coarse flint shingle. In this, as in similar cases, the
material has been dragged seawards from the land by constant action of
the undertow that accompanies each retreating tide and each
returning wave. The resulting accumulated ridge is battered by
every storm, and thrown above ordinary high-water mark in a
ridge such as the Chesil Bank or the long grass-grown mound that
has blocked the old channel of the Yar and diverted its waters
into Yaverland Bay. Sandown furnishes an instructive example
of the power of the eastward currents carrying high-storm waves.
The groins built to preserve the foreshore are piled to the top with
coarse shingle on the western side, while there is a drop of over
8 ft. on to the sands east of the wall, many thousands of tons of
shingle having been moved bodily by the waves and deposited
against each groin. The force of the waves has been measured on
the west coast of Scotland and found to be as much as 3 tons per
square foot. Against these forces the preservation of the shore
from the advance of the sea becomes an extremely difficult and
often a hopeless undertaking, since blocks of rock over 100 tons in
weight have been moved by the waves. The beach is therefore
unstable in its position. It advances in front of the encroaching
sea, burying former beaches under the sand and mud of the now
deeper water, or it retreats when the sea is withdrawn from the
land or the land rises locally, leaving the old shingle stranded in a
&ldquo;raised beach,&rdquo; but its formation is in all cases due to the form
and structure of the shore, the sapping action of the waves, the
backward drag of the undertow plastering the shore with material,
which is in turn bombarded by waves and swept by currents that
cover the finer débris of the undertow with a layer of coarse
fragments that are re-sorted by the daily action of currents and
tides.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEACHY HEAD,<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> a promontory on the coast of Sussex,
England, S.W. of Eastbourne, about 3 m. from the centre of the
town. It consists of a perpendicular chalk cliff 532 ft. high, and
forms the eastern termination of the hill-range known as the
South Downs. The old Bell Tout lighthouse, 285 ft. above high-water
mark, erected in 1831 on the second cliff to the westward,
in 0° 10&prime; 18&Prime; E., 50° 43&prime; 30&Prime; N., has been superseded by a new
lighthouse built in the sea at the foot of the head itself.</p>

<p><i>Battle of Beachy Head.</i>&mdash;This naval battle, known to the
French as Bévisier (a corruption of Pevensey), was fought on the
30th of June 1690. An allied force of 37 British sail of the line,
under command of the earl of Torrington (Arthur Herbert), and
of 22 Dutch under C. Evertsen, was at anchor under the headland,
while a French fleet of over 70 sail, commanded by the comte
de Tourville, was anchored some miles off to the south-west.
The French fleet had orders to co-operate with an expected
Jacobite rising in England. Torrington, to whom the general
direction of the allied fleet belonged, was much disturbed by the
enemy&rsquo;s superiority in number, and on the 26th had written to
the Council of Regency suggesting that he ought to retire to the
Gunfleet at the mouth of the Thames, and observe the enemy
from a distance till he could be reinforced. The council, which
had the support of Admiral Russell, afterwards earl of Orford,
considered that a retreat to the Gunfleet would have fatal
consequences, by which they no doubt meant that it would
leave the French free to land troops for the support of the
Jacobites. They therefore ordered Herbert not to lose sight of
the enemy, but rather to fight if he could secure an advantage
of position. The admiral, who was on very bad terms with the
council, elected to treat this as a peremptory order to fight. At
daybreak on the 30th he got under way and bore down on the
enemy. The wind was at north-east and gave him the weather-gage.
As his fleet was only 57 sail in all he was not able to engage
the enemy from end to end, but as the French were arranged
in a line from east to west he could have fallen on the end nearest
him, and could have guarded himself by telling off a part of his
ships to watch the remainder. Torrington preferred to bring
his fleet down in such a way that his van, consisting of the Dutch
ships, should be opposite the enemy&rsquo;s van, his centre opposite
their centre, and his rear should engage their rear. The
inferiority of the allies in numbers made it therefore inevitable
that there should be gaps between the different divisions. As
the fleets actually did come to action, the Dutch with a few
English ships pressed on the French van, their leading ship being
abreast of the ninth or tenth Frenchman. Torrington took his
station opposite the rear of the French centre, leaving a great
gap between himself and the ships in the van. Being apprehensive
that the French centre would tack and pass this gap so
as to put him between two fires, he kept a long way off so as to
be free to manoeuvre against them if they made the attempt.
The English rear division, consisting of the English blue
squadron under Sir Ralph Delaval, fought a close action with
the French opposite to them. In the meantime the French
ships, ahead of the leading Dutchman, succeeded in turning to
windward and putting part of Evertsen&rsquo;s squadron between
two fires. The Dutch ships suffered heavily, and one of them
which was dismasted drifted among the French and was taken.
More severe loss would have followed if the better average
seamanship of the English and Dutch had not stood them in
good stead. The tide turned from flood to ebb during the action,
and the surface current which in the Channel sets to the west
with the ebb began to carry the fleets with it. The Dutch and
English dropped anchor. The French, who were not equally
alert, did not and were carried westward. When the tide turned
the allies retreated to the Thames, abandoning several of the
most damaged ships in Pevensey Bay. The pursuit of the
French was ineffective, for Tourville persisted in keeping his
ships in line of battle, which forced them to regulate their
speed by the slowest among them. Torrington was tried for his
conduct but acquitted.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEACON<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> (from the O. Eng. <i>béacn</i>, a sign, cf. &ldquo;beckon,&rdquo;
another form of the same word), a signal, especially a fire lit on
a high hill, structure or building for the purpose of sending a
message of alarm or of important news over long distances.
Such was the courier-fire (<span class="grk" title="aggaros pur">&#7940;&#947;&#947;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#8166;&#961;</span>) that brought the news
of the fall of Troy to Argos (Aeschylus, <i>Agamemnon</i>), or the
chain of signals that told of the approach of the Spanish Armada,
or which circled the British Isles in the jubilee years of 1887 and
1897. The word occurs in many names for lofty and conspicuous
hills, such as Dunkery Beacon in Somerset, the highest point on
Exmoor. On many such hills the remains of old beacon towers
and cressets are still found. The word is used generally of a
lighthouse, but technically it means either a small unattended
light, a superstructure on a floating buoy, such as a staff and
cage, or staff and globe, or an unlighted structure, forming a
conspicuous object at sea, used in each case to guide or warn
sailors. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lighthouse</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Buoy</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEACONSFIELD, BENJAMIN DISRAELI,<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> <span class="sc">Earl of</span> (1804-1881),
British statesman, second child and eldest son of Isaac
D&rsquo;Israeli (<i>q.v.</i>) and Maria Basevi, who were married in 1802, was
born at No. 6 John Street, Bedford Row, on the 21st of December
1804. Of Isaac D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s other children, Sarah was born in
1802, Naphtali in 1807, Ralph (Raphael) in 1809, and James
(Jacob) in 1813. None of the family was akin to Benjamin for
genius and character, except Sarah, to whom he was deeply
indebted for a wise, unswerving and sympathetic devotion,
when, in his earlier days, he needed it most. All Isaac D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s
children were born into the Jewish communion, in which, however,
they were not to grow up. It is a reasonable inference
from Isaac&rsquo;s character that he was never at ease in the
ritual of Judaism. His father died in the winter of 1816, and
soon afterwards Isaac formally withdrew with all his household
from the Jewish church. His son Benjamin, who had been
admitted to it with the usual rites eight days after his birth, was
baptized at St Andrew&rsquo;s church in Holborn on the 31st of July
1817. One of Isaac D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s reasons for quitting the tents of
his people was that rabbinical Judaism, with its unyielding
laws and fettering ceremonies, &ldquo;cuts off the Jews from the great
family of mankind.&rdquo; Little did he know, when therefore he cut
off the D&rsquo;Israeli family from Judaism, what great things he was
doing for one small member of it. The future prime minister
was then short of thirteen years old, and there was yet time to
provide the utmost freedom which his birth allowed for the
faculties and ambitions he was born with. Taking the worldly
view alone, of course, most fortunate for his aspirations in youth
was his withdrawal from Judaism in childhood. That it was
fully sanctioned by his intellect at maturity is evident; but the
vindication of unbiased choice would not have been readily
accepted had Disraeli abandoned Judaism of his own will at the
pushing <i>Vivian Grey</i> period or after. And though a mind like
Disraeli&rsquo;s might work to satisfaction with Christianity as &ldquo;completed
Judaism,&rdquo; it could but dwell on a breach of continuity
which means so much to Jews and which he was never allowed
to forget amongst Christians. With all, he was proud of his race
as truly, if not as vehemently, as his paternal grandmother
detested it. Family pride contributed to the feeling in his case;
for in his more speculative moods he could look back upon an
ancestry which was of those, perhaps, who colonized the shores
of the Mediterranean from before the time of the Captivity.
More definite is the history of descent from an ennobled Spanish
family which escaped from the Torquemada persecutions to
Venice, there found a new home, took a new name, and prospered
for six generations. The Benjamin D&rsquo;Israeli, Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s
grandfather, who came to England in 1748, was a younger
son sent at eighteen to try his fortune in London. &ldquo;A man of
ardent character, sanguine, courageous, speculative, fortunate,
with a temper which no disappointment could disturb&rdquo; (so
Lord Beaconsfield described him), he soon made the beginnings
of a handsome fortune and turned country gentleman. That his
grandson exaggerated his prosperity is highly probable; but
that he became a man of wealth and consideration is certain.
He married twice. His second wife was Sarah Siprout de Gabay,
&ldquo;a beautiful woman of strong intellect&rdquo; and importunate
ambitions, who hated the race she belonged to because it was
despised by others. She felt so keenly the social disabilities it
brought upon her, and her husband&rsquo;s indifference to them, that
&ldquo;she never pardoned him his name.&rdquo; Her literary son Isaac
suffered equally or even more; for though he had ambitions he
had none that she could recognize as such. She could ridicule
him for the aspirations which he had not and for those which he
had; on the other hand, he never heard from her a tender word
&ldquo;though she lived to be eighty.&rdquo; Nor did any other member of
her family, according to her grandson.</p>

<p>Isaac D&rsquo;Israeli was devoted to the reading and writing of books
in domestic quiet; and his son Benjamin suffered appreciably
from his father&rsquo;s gentle preoccupations. As a child&mdash;unruly
and disturbing no doubt&mdash;he was sent to a school of small
account at Blackheath, and was there &ldquo;for years&rdquo; before he
was recalled at the age of twelve on the death of his grandfather.
Isaac D&rsquo;Israeli was his father&rsquo;s sole heritor, but change of fortune
seems to have awakened in him no ambitions for the most hopeful
of his sons. At fifteen, not before, Benjamin was sent to a
Unitarian school at Walthamstow&mdash;a well-known school,
populous enough to be a little world of emulation and conflict
but otherwise unfit. Not there, nor in any similar institution
at that illiberal time, perhaps, was a Jewish boy likely to make
a fortunate entry into &ldquo;the great family of mankind.&rdquo; His
name, the foreign look of him, and some pronounced incompatibilities
not all chargeable to young Disraeli (as afterwards
the name came to be spelt), soon raised a crop of troubles. His
stay at Walthamstow was brief, his departure abrupt, and he
went to school no more. With the run of his father&rsquo;s library,
and the benefits of that born bookman&rsquo;s guidance, he now set
out to educate himself. This he did with an industry stiffened
by matchless self-confidence and by ambitions fully mature
before he was eighteen. Yet he yielded to an attempt to make a
man of business of him. He was barely seventeen when (in
November 1821) he was taken into the office of Messrs Swain,
Stevens and Co., solicitors, in Frederick&rsquo;s Place, Old Jewry.
Here he remained for three years&mdash;&ldquo;most assiduous in his
attention to business,&rdquo; said one of the partners, &ldquo;and showing
great ability in the transaction of it.&rdquo; It was then determined
that he should go to the bar; and accordingly he was entered
at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in 1824. But Disraeli had found other studies
and an alien use for his pen. Though &ldquo;assiduous in his attention
to business&rdquo; in Frederick&rsquo;s Place, he found time to write for
the printer. Dr Smiles, in his <i>Memoirs of John Murray</i>, tells
of certain pamphlets on the brightening prospects of the Spanish
South American colonies, then in the first enjoyment of emancipation&mdash;pamphlets
seemingly written for a Mr Powles, head of a
great financial firm, whose acquaintance Disraeli had made. In
the same year, apparently, he wrote a novel&mdash;his first, and never
published. <i>Aylmer Papillon</i> was the title of it, Dr Smiles
informs us; and he prints a letter from Disraeli to the John
Murray of that day, which indicates its character pretty clearly.
The last chapter, its author says, is taken up with &ldquo;Mr Papillon&rsquo;s
banishment under the Alien Act, from a ministerial misconception
of a metaphysical sonnet.&rdquo; About the same time he edited
a <i>History of Paul Jones</i>, originally published in America, the
preface of the English edition being Disraeli&rsquo;s first appearance
as an author. Murray could not publish <i>Aylmer Papillon</i>,
but he had great hopes of its boyish writer (Isaac D&rsquo;Israeli was
an old friend of his), &ldquo;took him into his confidence, and related
to him his experiences of men and affairs.&rdquo; Disraeli had not
completed his twenty-first year when (in 1825) Murray was
possessed by the idea of bringing out a great daily newspaper;
<span class="sidenote">&ldquo;The Representative.&rdquo;</span>
and if his young friend did not inspire that idea he
keenly urged its execution, and was entrusted by
Murray with the negotiation of all manner of preliminaries,
including the attempt to bring Lockhart
in as editor. The title of the paper, <i>The Representative</i>, was
Disraeli&rsquo;s suggestion. He chose reporters, looked to the setting-up
of a printing-office, busied himself in all ways to Murray&rsquo;s
great satisfaction, and, as fully appears from Dr Smiles&rsquo;s account
of the matter, with extraordinary address. But when these
arrangements were brought to the point of completion, Disraeli
dropped out of the scheme and had nothing more to do with it.
He was to have had a fourth share of the proprietorship, bringing
in a corresponding amount of capital. His friend Mr Powles,
whom he had enlisted for the enterprise, was to have had a
similar share on the same conditions. Neither seems to have paid
up, and that, perhaps, had to do with the quarrel which parted
Benjamin Disraeli and John Murray before a sheet of the luckless
<i>Representative</i> was printed. Many years afterwards (1853)
Disraeli took an active interest in <i>The Press</i>, a weekly journal
of considerable merit but meagre fortunes.</p>

<p>At the death of the elder Benjamin (1817), his son Isaac had
moved from the King&rsquo;s Road, Gray&rsquo;s Inn (now Theobald&rsquo;s Road),
to No. 6 Bloomsbury Square. Here he entertained the many
distinguished friends, literary and political, who had been
drawn to him by his &ldquo;Curiosities&rdquo; and other ingenious works,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page564" id="page564"></a>564</span>
and here his son Benjamin also had their acquaintance and
conversation. In Bloomsbury Square lived the Austens, and
to their house, a great resort of similar persons, Mrs Austen
cordially welcomed him. Murray&rsquo;s friendship and associations
helped him in like manner, no doubt; and thus was opened
to Disraeli the younger a world in which he was to make a
considerable stir. The very much smaller society of that day
was, of course, more comprehensible to sight and hearing, when
once you were within its borders, than the society of this.
Reverberations of the gossip of St James&rsquo;s and Mayfair extended
to Bloomsbury in those days. Yet Disraeli&rsquo;s range of observation
<span class="sidenote">&ldquo;Vivan Grey.&rdquo;</span>
must have been not only brief but limited when he
sat down at twenty or twenty-one to write <i>Vivian Grey</i>.
It is therefore a probable conjecture that Mrs Austen,
a clever woman of the world, helped him from her knowledge.
His own strongly perceptive imagination (the gift in which
he was to excel every other politician of his time) and the bent
of political reading and aspiration from boyhood completed his
equipment; and so the wonder that so young a man in Disraeli&rsquo;s
social position should write a book like <i>Vivian Grey</i> is accounted
for. It was published in 1826. The success of this insolently
clever novel, the immediate introduction of its author to the
great world, and the daring eccentricities of dress, demeanour,
and opinion by which he fixed attention on himself there, have
always been among the most favourite morsels of Disraeli&rsquo;s
history. With them it began, and successive generations of
inquirers into a strange career and a character still shrouded
and baffling refer to them as settled starting-points of
investigation. What was the man who, in such a society and with
political aspirations to serve, could thrive by such vagaries as
these, or in spite of them? If unaffected, what is to be thought
of them as keys to character? If affected, what then? Inquiry
still takes this shape, and when any part of Disraeli&rsquo;s career is
studied, the laces and essences, the rings over gloves, the jewelled
satin shirt-fronts, the guitareries and chibouqueries of his early
days are never remote from memory. The report of them
can hardly be doubted; and as the last relation was made
(to the writer of this article) not with intent to ridicule Mr
Disraeli&rsquo;s taste but to illustrate his conquering abilities, the
story is repeated here. One of Disraeli&rsquo;s first friends in the world
of fashion and genius was Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer. &ldquo;And,&rdquo;
said Sir Henry Bulwer (&ldquo;Pelham&rsquo;s&rdquo; brother), &ldquo;we heard so
much at the time of Edward&rsquo;s amazingly brilliant new friend
that we were the less inclined to make his acquaintance.&rdquo; At
length, however, Sir Edward got up a little dinner-party to
convince the doubters. It was to meet at the early hour of those
days at one of the Piccadilly hotels. &ldquo;There was my brother,
Alexander Cockburn, myself and (I think) Milnes; but for a
considerable time no Mr Disraeli. Waiting for Mr Disraeli did
not enhance the pleasure of meeting him, nor when he did arrive
did his appearance predispose us in his favour. He wore green
velvet trousers, a canary-coloured waistcoat, low shoes, silver
buckles, lace at his wrists, and his hair in ringlets.&rdquo; The
description of the coat is forgotten. &ldquo;We sat down. Not one of us
was more than five-and-twenty years old. We were all&mdash;if you
will allow me to include myself&mdash;on the road to distinction,
all clever, all ambitious, and all with a perfect conceit of ourselves.
Yet if on leaving the table we had been severally taken aside and
asked which was the cleverest of the party, we should have been
obliged to say &lsquo;the man in the green velvet trousers.&rsquo;&rdquo; This
story is a little lamp that throws much light. Here we see at
their sharpest the social prejudices that Disraeli had to fight
against, provocation of them carried to its utmost in every
way open to him, and complete conquest in a company of young
men less likely to admit superiority in a wit of their own years,
probably, than any other that could have been brought together
at that time.</p>

<p>Soon after the publication of <i>Vivian Grey</i>, Disraeli, who is said
by Froude to have been &ldquo;overtaken by a singular disorder,&rdquo;
marked by fits of giddiness (&ldquo;once he fell into a trance, and did
not recover for a week&rdquo;), went with the Austens on a long summer
tour in France, Switzerland and Italy. Returning to a quiet life
at Bradenham&mdash;an old manor-house near High Wycombe, which
his father had taken&mdash;Disraeli put law in abeyance and resumed
novel-writing. His weakest book, and two or three other productions,
brief, but in every literary sense the finest of his works,
were written in the next two or three years. But for <i>Ixion in
Heaven</i>, <i>The Infernal Marriage</i>, and <i>Popanilla</i>, Disraeli could not
be placed among the greater writers of his kind; yet none of his
imaginative books have been so little read as these. The
mysterious malady continued, and Disraeli set out with William
<span class="sidenote">Travel.</span>
Meredith, who was to have married Sarah Disraeli, for
a tour in southern Europe and the nearer East. He
saw Cadiz, Seville, Granada, Athens, Constantinople, Jerusalem,
Cairo, Thebes; played the corsair with James Clay on a yacht
voyage from Malta to Corfu; visited the terrible Reschid, then
with a Turkish army in the Albanian capital; landed in Cyprus,
and left it with an expectation in his singularly prescient mind
that the island would one day be English. These travels must
have profited him greatly, and we have our share of the advantage;
not so much, however, in <i>The Wondrous Tale of Alroy</i> or
<i>Tancred</i>, or the &ldquo;Revolutionary Epic&rdquo; which he was inspired to
write on &ldquo;the windy plains of Troy,&rdquo; but in the letters he sent
home to his sister. These letters, written with the utmost freedom
and fullness to the one whose affection and intellect he trusted
more than any, are of the greatest value for interpreting the
writer. Together with other letters also published some time
after Disraeli&rsquo;s death, they tell more of him than anything that
can be found in print elsewhere. They show, for example, that
his extraordinary exuberances were unforced, leaping by natural
impulse from an overcharged source. They also show that his
Oriental fopperies were not so much &ldquo;purposed affectation&rdquo; as
Froude and others have surmised. That they were so in great
part is confessed again and again in these letters, but confessed in
such a way as to reveal that they were permitted for his own
enjoyment of them as much as planned. The &ldquo;purposed
affectation&rdquo; sprang from an unaffected delight in gauds of attire,
gauds of fancy and expression. It was not only to startle and
impress the world that he paraded his eccentricities of splendour.
His family also had to be impressed by them. It was to his sober
father that he wrote, at the age of twenty-six: &ldquo;I like a sailor&rsquo;s
life much, though it spoils the toilette.&rdquo; It is in a letter from
Gibraltar to the same hand that we read of his two canes&mdash;&ldquo;a
morning and an evening cane&rdquo;&mdash;changed as the gun fires. And
the same correspondent must be told that &ldquo;Ralph&rsquo;s handkerchief
which he brought me from Paris is the most successful thing I ever
wore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Disraeli returned to England in 1831, all thought of the
law was abandoned. The pen of romance was again taken up&mdash;the
poet&rsquo;s also and the politician&rsquo;s. In the next five
years he wrote <i>Contarini Fleming</i>, the <i>Revolutionary
Epick, Alroy, Henrietta Temple, What is He?</i> (a
<span class="sidenote">Literary production.</span>
pamphlet expository of his opinions), the <i>Runnymede
Letters</i>, a <i>Vindication of the British Constitution</i>, and other matter
of less note. The epic, begun in great hope and confidence, was
ended in less, though its author was to the last unwilling that it
should be forgotten. The novels revived the success he had with
<i>Vivian Grey</i>, and restored him to his place among the brilliancies
and powers of the time. The political writing, too, much of it in
a garish, extravagant style, exercised his deeper ambitions, and
stands as witness to the working of original thought and foresight.
Both qualities are conspicuous in <i>What is He?</i> and the <i>Vindication</i>,
of which it has been truly said that in these pages he &ldquo;struck
the keynote to the explanations he afterwards consistently offered
of all his apparent inconsistencies.&rdquo; Here an interpretation of
Tory principles as capable of running with the democratic idea,
and as called upon to do so, is ingeniously attempted. The
aristocratic principle of government having been destroyed by
the Reform Bill, and the House of Lords being practically
&ldquo;abrogated&rdquo; by that measure, it became necessary that Toryism
should start from the democratic basis, from which it had never
been alien. The filched liberties of the crown and the people
should be restored, and the nation redeemed from the oligarchies
which had stolen from both. When at the beginning of all this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page565" id="page565"></a>565</span>
writing Disraeli entered the political arena as candidate for High
Wycombe (1832), he was nominated by a Tory and seconded by a
Radical&mdash;in vain; and vain were two subsequent attempts in the
autumn of 1832 and in 1834. In the first he was recommended to
the electors by Daniel O&rsquo;Connell and the Radical Hume. In his
last candidature at Wycombe he stood on more independent
ground, commending himself by a series of speeches which fully
displayed his quality, though the prescience which gemmed them
with more than one prophetic passage was veiled from his
contemporaries. Among Disraeli&rsquo;s great acquaintances were
many&mdash;Lyndhurst at their head&mdash;whose expectations of his
future were confirmed by the Wycombe speeches. He was
&ldquo;thought of&rdquo; for various boroughs, Marylebone among the
number, but his democratic Toryism seems to have stood in his
way in some places and his inborn dislike of Radicalism in others.
It was an impracticable situation&mdash;no getting on from it; and so,
at Lyndhurst&rsquo;s persuasion, as he afterwards acknowledged, he
determined to side with the Tories. Accordingly, when in the
spring of 1835 a vacancy occurred at Taunton, Disraeli contested
the seat in the Tory interest with Carlton Club support. Here
again he failed, but with enhanced reputation as a fighting
politician and with other consequences good for notoriety. It
was at Taunton that Disraeli fell upon O&rsquo;Connell, rather ungratefully;
whereupon the Liberator was roused to retort on his
assailant vehemently as &ldquo;a liar,&rdquo; and humorously as a probable
descendant of the impenitent thief. And then followed the
challenge which, when O&rsquo;Connell declined it, was fastened on his
son Morgan, and the interruption of the duel by seizure of Mr
Disraeli in his bed, and his famous appearance in the Marylebone
police court. He declared himself very well satisfied with this
episode, but nothing in it can really have pleased him, not even
the noise it made.</p>

<p>Here the first period of Disraeli&rsquo;s public life came to an end, a
period of preliminaries and flourishes, and of what he himself
called sowing his political wild oats. It was a more
mature Disraeli who in the general election of 1837 was
<span class="sidenote">Enters Parliament.</span>
returned for Maidstone as the colleague of his
providential friend Mr Wyndham Lewis. Though the
fortunes of the Tory party were fast reviving under Peel&rsquo;s
guidance, the victory was denied him on this occasion; but, for
once, the return of the Whigs to power was no great disappointment
for the junior member for Maidstone. To gain a footing in
the House of Commons was all that his confident spirit ever asked,
and Froude vouches for it that he succeeded only just in time to
avert financial ruin. His electioneering ventures, the friendly
backing of bills, and his own expense in keeping up appearances,
had loaded him with debt. Yet (mark his worldly wisdom) &ldquo;he
had never entangled his friends in his financial dealings. He had
gone frankly to the professional money-lenders, who made
advances to him in a speculation on his success&rdquo;: they were to
get their money back with large interest or lose it altogether.
Such conditions were themselves incitement enough to a prompt
redemption of the promise of parliamentary distinction, even
without the restless spurring of ambition. And Disraeli had
another promise to redeem: that which he uttered when he told
O&rsquo;Connell that they would meet again at Philippi. Therefore
when, three weeks after the session began, a debate on Irish
election petitions gave him opportunity, Disraeli attempted that
first House of Commons speech which imagination still dwells
upon as something wondrous strange. That he should not have
known better, even by hearsay, than to address the House of
Commons in fantastic phrase from the mouth of a fantastic figure
is indeed remarkable, but not that he retained self-confidence
enough to tell the unwitting crew who laughed him down that a
time would come when they would hear him. It was one of the
least memorable of his prophecies. The speech was a humiliating
but not an oppressive failure. In about a week afterwards he
spoke again, which shows how little damage he felt, while the good
sense, brevity, and blameless manner of the speech (on a copyright
bill) announced that he could learn. And for some time
thereafter he affected no importance in the House, though not as
withdrawing from attention.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, consciously and unconsciously, as is the way
with men of genius, his mind was working upon problems of
government, the magnitude, the relations and the natural
developments of which he was more sensible of than any known
politician of his time. &ldquo;Sensible of,&rdquo; we say, to mark the
difference between one sort of understanding and another which
comes of labour and pains alone. Disraeli studied too, no doubt,
reading and inquiring and applying set thought, but such means
were insufficient to put into his mind all that he found there.
It seems that opinions may be formed of inquiry and study alone,
which are then constructive; but where intuitive perception or
the perceptive imagination is a robust possession, the fruits of
research become assimilative&mdash;the food of a divining faculty
which needs more or less of it according to the power of divination.
The better judgment in all affairs derives from this quality,
which has some very covetable advantages for its possessor.
His judgments may be held with greater confidence, which is
an intellectual advantage; and, standing in his mind not so
<span class="sidenote">Mental characteristics.</span>
much an edifice as a natural growth, they cannot be
so readily abandoned at the call of ease or self-interest.
They may be denied assertion or even outraged for a
purpose, but they cannot be got rid of,&mdash;which is a
moral advantage. Disraeli&rsquo;s mind and its judgments were of
this character. Its greatest gift was not the romantic imagination
which he possessed abundantly and employed overmuch, but
the perceptive, interpretative, judicial or divining imagination,
without which there can be no great man of affairs. Breadth
of view, insight, foresight, are more familiar but less adequate
descriptions of a faculty which Disraeli had in such force that
it took command of him from first to last. Although he knew
and acted on the principle that &ldquo;a statesman is a practical
character,&rdquo; whose business is to &ldquo;serve the country according
to its present necessities,&rdquo; he was unable to confine his vision
to the nearer consequences of whatever policy, or course of
action, or group of conditions it rested on. Without effort, and
even without intention probably, it looked beyond first consequences
to the farther or the final outcome; and to complete
the operation, the faculty which detected the remoter consequences
did not allow them to remain in obscurity, but brought
them out as actualities no less than the first and perhaps far
more important than the first. Moreover, it did not allow him
to keep silence where the remoter consequences were of that
character, and ought to be provided for betimes. Of course
silence was always possible. These renderings to foresight
might be denied assertion either for the sake of present ease (and
Disraeli&rsquo;s prescience of much of his country&rsquo;s later troubles only
made him laughed at) or in deference to hopes of personal
advancement. But the same divining imagination which
showed him these things also showed him the near time when it
would be too late to speak of them, and when not to have spoken
would leave him irredeemably in the common herd of hand-to-mouth
politicians. Therefore he spoke.</p>

<p>Remembrance of these characteristics&mdash;remembrance, too,
that his mind, which was neither English nor European, worked
in absolute detachment&mdash;should accompany the traveller
through all the turns and incidents of Disraeli&rsquo;s long career.
They are sometimes puzzling, often speculative; yet nearly all
that is obscure in them becomes clear, much apparent contradiction
disappears, when read by these persistent unvarying
lights. The command which his idiosyncrasies had upon him
is shown, for example, by reproachful speeches on the treatment
of Ireland, and by a startling harangue on behalf of the Chartists,
at a time when such irregularities could but damage him, a new
man, where he hoped for influence and office. At about the
same time his political genius directed him to open a resolute
critical campaign against the Conservatism of the party he
<span class="sidenote">&ldquo;Coningsby,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sybil.&rdquo;</span>
proposed to thrive in, and he could but obey. This
he did in writing <i>Coningsby</i>, a novel of the day and for
the day, but commended to us of a later generation
not only by the undimmed truth of its character-portraits,
but by qualities of insight and foresight which we who
have seen the proof of them can measure as his contemporaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page566" id="page566"></a>566</span>
could not. <i>Sybil</i>, which was written in the following year (1845),
is still more remarkable for the faculties celebrated in the preceding
paragraph. When <i>Sybil</i> was written a long historic day
was ending in England, a new era beginning; and no eyes saw
so clearly as Disraeli&rsquo;s the death of the old day, the birth of the
new, or what and how great their differences would be. In
<i>Coningsby</i> the political conditions of the country were illustrated
and discussed from the constitutional point of view, and by light
of the theory that for generations before the passing of the
Reform Bill the authority of the crown and the liberties of the
people had been absorbed and extinguished in an oligarchic
system of government, itself become fossilized and soulless. In
<i>Sybil</i> were exhibited the social relations of rich and poor (the
&ldquo;two nations&rdquo;) under this régime, and under changes in which,
while the peasantry were neglected by a shoddy aristocracy
ignorant of its duties, factory life and a purblind gospel of
political economy imbruted the rest of the population. These
views were enforced by a startling yet strictly accurate representation
of the state of things in the factory districts at that
time. Taken from the life by Disraeli himself, accompanied by
one or two members of the Young England party of which he
was the head, it was the first of its kind; and the facts as there
displayed, and Disraeli&rsquo;s interpretation of them&mdash;a marvel of
perceptive and prophetic criticism&mdash;opened eyes, roused
consciences, and led direct to many reforms.</p>

<p>These two books, the <i>Vindication</i>, published in 1835, and his
speeches up to this time and a little beyond, are quite enough
to show what Disraeli&rsquo;s Tory democracy meant, how truly
national was its aim, and how exclusive of partisanship for the
&ldquo;landed interest&rdquo;; though he did believe the stability and
prosperity of the agricultural class a national interest of the
first order, not on economic grounds alone or even chiefly. And
if Disraeli, possessed by these views, became aggressively
insubordinate some time before Peel&rsquo;s proclaimed conversion
to Free Trade, we can account for it on reasonable and even
creditable grounds. Spite, resentment at being passed over
when Peel formed the 1841 government, is one explanation of
these outbreaks, and a letter to Peel, lately published, is proof
to many minds that Disraeli&rsquo;s denial to Peel&rsquo;s face in 1846 that
he had ever solicited office was daringly mendacious. The
letter certainly reads like solicitation in the customary half-veiled
form. All that can be said in doubt is that since the &rsquo;41
government came into existence on the 6th of September, and
the letter was written on the 5th, its interpretation as complaint
of being publicly neglected, as a craving for <i>some</i> mark of
recognition, is possible. More than possible it is if Disraeli knew on
the 5th (as he very well might from his friend Lyndhurst, Peel&rsquo;s
lord chancellor) that the appointments were then complete.
The pecuniary need of office, if that comes into the question,
had been lightened, if not extinguished, two years before by his
marriage with Mrs Wyndham Lewis. Mrs Lewis&mdash;a lady
fifteen years his senior&mdash;brought him a considerable fortune
which, however, was but for her life. She lived to a great age,
and would gladly have lived longer, in any of the afflictions that
time brings on, to continue her mere money-worth to her
&ldquo;Dizzy.&rdquo; Her devotion to him, and his devotion to her, is the
whole known story of their private life; and we may believe
that nothing ever gratified him more than offering her a coronet
from Mr Disraeli.</p>

<p>Disraeli made Peel&rsquo;s acquaintance early in his career and
showed that he was proud of it. In his <i>Life of Lord George
Bentinck</i> he writes of Peel fairly and even generously. But they
were essentially antipathetic persons; and it is clear that the
great minister and complete Briton took no pains to understand
the dazzling young Jew of whom Lyndhurst thought so much,
and wished to have little to do with him. Such men make such
feelings evident; and there is no reason for thinking that when,
after 1841, Disraeli charged at Peel in obedience to his principles,
he gave himself pain. It was not long after it had settled in
office that Peel&rsquo;s government, the creature of an anxious
Conservative reaction, began to be suspected of drifting toward
Manchester. That it was forced in that direction we should
say rather, looking back, for it was a time of dire distress,
especially in the manufacturing districts of the north; so
<span class="sidenote">Politics. 1841-67.</span>
that in his second session Peel had to provide some
relief by revising the corn laws and reducing import
dues generally. His measures were supported by
Disraeli, who understood that Protection must bend to the
menacing poverty of the time, though unprepared for total
abolition of the corn tax and strongly of opinion that it was
not for Peel to abolish it. In the next session (1843) he and his
Young England party took up a definitely independent rôle,
which became more sharply critical to the end. Disraeli&rsquo;s first
strong vote of hostility was on a coercion bill for perishing and
rebellious Ireland. It was repeated with greater emphasis in
the session of 1844, also in a condition-of-Ireland debate; and
from that time forth, as if foreseeing Peel&rsquo;s course and its effect
on the country party, Disraeli kept up the attack. Meanwhile
bad harvests deepened the country&rsquo;s distress, Ireland was
approached by famine, the Anti-Corn-Law League became
menacingly powerful, and Peel showed signs of yielding to free
trade. Disraeli&rsquo;s opportunity was soon to come now; and in
1845, seeing it on the way, he launched the brilliantly destructive
series of speeches which, though they could not prevent the
abolition of the corn-laws, abolished the minister who ended
them. These speeches appeal more to admiration than to
sympathy, even where the limitations of Disraeli&rsquo;s protectionist
beliefs are understood and where his perception of the later
consequences of free trade is most cordially acknowledged. That
he remained satisfied with them himself is doubtful, unless for
their foresight, their tremendous effect as instruments of
punishment, and as they swept him to so much distinction. Within
three years, on the death of Lord George Bentinck, there was
none to dispute with him the leadership of the Conservative
party in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>In the parliament of 1841 he was member for Shrewsbury.
In 1847 he was returned for Buckinghamshire, and never again
had occasion to change his constituency. Up to this time his
old debts still embarrassed him, but now his private and political
fortunes changed together. Froude reports that he &ldquo;received
a large sum from a private hand for his <i>Life of Lord George
Bentinck</i>&rdquo; (published in 1852), &ldquo;while a Conservative millionaire
took upon himself the debts to the usurers; the 3% with which
he was content being exchanged for the 10% under which
Disraeli had been staggering.&rdquo; In 1848 his father Isaac D&rsquo;Israeli
died, leaving to his son Benjamin nearly the whole of his estate.
This went to the purchase of Hughenden Manor&mdash;not, of course,
a great property, but with so much of the pleasant and picturesque,
of the dignified also, as quite to explain what it was to the
affectionate fancy of its lord. About this time, too (1851), his
acquaintance was sought by an old Mrs Brydges Willyams&mdash;born
a Spanish Jewess and then the widow of a long-deceased
Cornish squire&mdash;who in her distant home at Torquay had
conceived a restless admiration for Benjamin Disraeli. She
wrote to him again and again, pressing for an appointment to
consult on an important matter of business: would meet him
at the fountain of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park. Her importunity
succeeded, and the very small, oddly-dressed, strange-mannered
old lady whom Disraeli met at the fountain became
his adoring friend to the end of her life. Gratitude for her
devotion brought him and his wife in constant intimacy
with her. There were many visits to Torquay; he gratified
her with gossiping letters about the great people with
whom and the great affairs with which the man who did so
much honour to her race was connected, that being the inspiration
of her regard for him. She died in 1863, leaving him all
her fortune, which was considerable; and, as she wished,
was buried at Hughenden, close to the grave where Disraeli
was to lie.</p>

<p>It is agreed that the first three years of Disraeli&rsquo;s leadership
in Opposition were skilfully employed in reconstructing the
shattered Tory party. In doing this he made it sufficiently
clear that there could be no sudden return to Protectionist
principles. At the same time, however, he insisted (as he did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page567" id="page567"></a>567</span>
from first to last) on the enormous importance to the country, to
the character of its people no less than to its material welfare,
of agricultural contentment and prosperity; and he also obtained
<span class="sidenote">As leader in the House of Commons.</span>
a more general recognition of the fact that &ldquo;the land&rdquo;
had borne fiscal burdens under the old régime which
were unfair and unendurable under the new. So far he
did well; and when in 1852 he took office as chancellor
of the exchequer in Lord Derby&rsquo;s first administration, the
prospect was a smiling one for a man who, striving against
difficulties and prejudices almost too formidable for imagination
in these days, had attained to a place where he could fancy
them all giving way. That, however, they were not. New
difficulties were to arise and old prejudices to revive in full force.
His first budget was a quaint failure, and was thrown out by a
coalition of Liberals and Peelites which he believed was formed
against Mr Disraeli more than against the chancellor of the
exchequer. It was on this occasion that he exclaimed, &ldquo;England
does not love coalitions.&rdquo; After a reign of ten months he was
again in Opposition, and remained so for seven years. Of the
Crimean War he had a better judgment than those whose weakness
led them into it, and he could tell them the whole truth of
the affair in twenty words: &ldquo;You are going to war with an
opponent who does not want to fight, and whom you are unwilling
to encounter.&rdquo; Neither were they prepared; and the
scandals and political disturbances that ensued revealed him as
a party leader who could act on such occasions with a dignity,
moderation and sagacity that served his country well, maintained
the honour of party government and cost his friends nothing.
The mismanagement of the war broke down the Aberdeen
government in 1855, and then Disraeli had the mortification of
seeing a fortunate chance of return to office lost by the timidity
and distrust of his chief, Lord Derby&mdash;the distrust too clearly
including the under-valuation of Disraeli himself. Lord Derby
wanted Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s help, Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s, Mr Sidney
Herbert&rsquo;s. This arrangement could not be made; Lord Derby
therefore gave up the attempt to form a ministry and Lord
Palmerston came in. The next chance was taken in less favouring
times. The government in which Disraeli was again financial
minister lasted for less than eighteen months (1858-1859), and
then ensued another seven years in the cold and yet colder shade
of Opposition. Both of these seven-year outings were bad, but
the second by far the worse. Parliamentary reform had become
a burning question and an embarrassing one for the Tory party.
An enormous increase of business, consequent upon the use of
steam machinery and free-trade openings to commerce, filled
the land with prosperity, and discredited all statesmanship but
that which steered by the star over Manchester. Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s
budgets, made possible by this prosperity, were so many triumphs
for Liberalism. Foreign questions arose which strongly excited
English feeling&mdash;the arrangements of peace with Russia, Italian
struggles for freedom, an American quarrel, the &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; affair
and the Chinese war, the affair of the French colonels and the
Conspiracy Bill; and as they arose Palmerston gathered into
his own sails (except on the last occasion) every wind of popular
favour. Amid all this the Tory fortunes sank rapidly, becoming
nearly hopeless when Lord Palmerston, without appreciable
loss of confidence on his own side, persuaded many Tories in and
out of parliament that Conservatism would suffer little while
he was in power. Yet there was great despondency, of course,
in the Conservative ranks; with despondency discontent; with
discontent rancour. The prejudice against Disraeli as Jew, the
revolt at his theatricalisms, the distrust of him as &ldquo;mystery
man,&rdquo; which up to this time had never died out even among
men who were his nearest colleagues, were now more openly
indulged. Out of doors he had a &ldquo;bad press,&rdquo; in parliament
he had some steady, enthusiastic friends, but more that were
cold. Sometimes he was seen on the front Opposition bench for
hours quite alone. Little conspiracies were got up to displace
him, and might have succeeded but for an unconquerable dread
of the weapon that destroyed Peel. In this state of things he
patiently held his ground, working for his party more carefully
than it knew, and never seizing upon false or discrediting
advantages. But it was an extremely bad time for Benjamin
Disraeli.</p>

<p>Though Lord Palmerston stumbled over his Foreign Conspiracy
Bill in 1858, his popularity was little damaged, and it was in no
hopeful spirit that the Tories took office again in that year. They
were perilously weak in the House of Commons, and affairs
abroad, in which they had small practice and no prestige, were
alarming. Yet the new administration did very well till, after
resettling the government of India, and recovering from a blunder
committed by their Indian secretary, Lord Ellenborough, they
must needs launch a Reform Bill to put that dangerous question
out of controversial politics. The well-intended but fantastic
measure brought in for the purpose was rejected. The country
was appealed to, with good but insufficient results; and at the
first meeting of the new parliament the Tories were turned out on
a no-confidence vote moved by Lord Hartington. Foreign affairs
supplied the motive: failure to preserve the peace of Europe at
the time of the Italian war of independence. It is said that the
foreign office had then in print a series of despatches which would
have answered its accusers had they been presented when the
debate began, as for some unexplained reason they were not.
Lord Palmerston now returned to Downing Street, and while he
lived Disraeli and his colleagues had to satisfy themselves with
what was meant for useful criticism, though with small hope that
it was so for their own service. A Polish insurrection, the
Schleswig-Holstein question, a commercial treaty with France,
the Civil War in America, gave Disraeli occasions for speech that
was always forcible and often wiser than all could see at the time.
He never doubted that England should be strictly neutral in the
American quarrel when there was a strong feeling in favour of the
South. All the while he would have gladly welcomed any just
means of taking an animated course, for these were dull, dark
days for the Conservatives as a parliamentary party. Yet,
unperceived, Conservatism was advancing. It was much more
than a joke that Palmerston sheltered Conservative principles
under the Liberal flag. The warmth of his popularity, to which
Radical applause contributed nothing in his later days, created an
atmosphere entirely favourable to the quiet growth of Conservatism.
He died in 1865. Earl Russell succeeded him as prime
minister, Mr Gladstone as leader of the House of Commons. The
party most pleased with the change was the Radical; the party
best served was Disraeli&rsquo;s. Another Reform Bill, memorable for
driving certain good Liberals into a Cave of Aduilam, broke up
the new government in a few months; Disraeli contributing to
the result by the delivery of opinions not new to him and of
lasting worth, though presently to be subordinated to arguments
of an inferior order and much less characteristic. &ldquo;At this rate,&rdquo;
he said in 1866, &ldquo;you will have a parliament that will entirely
lose its command over the executive, and it will meet with less
consideration and possess less influence.&rdquo; Look for declining
statesmanship, inferior aptitude, genius dying off. &ldquo;Instead of
these you will have a horde of selfish and obscure mediocrities,
incapable of anything but mischief, and that mischief devised and
regulated by the raging demagogue of the hour.&rdquo; The Reform
legislation which promised these results in 1866 was thrown out.
Lord Derby&rsquo;s third administration was then formed in the
summer of the same year, and for the third time there was a Tory
government on sufferance. Its followers were still a minority in
the House of Commons; an angry Reform agitation was going
on; an ingenious resolution founded on the demand for an
enlarged franchise serviceable to Liberals might extinguish the
new government almost immediately; and it is pretty evident
that the Tory leaders took office meaning to seek a cure for this
<span class="sidenote">Reform Bill of 1867.</span>
desperate weakness by wholesale extension of the
suffrage. Their excuses and calculations are well
known, but when all is said, Lord Derby&rsquo;s statement of
its character, &ldquo;a leap in the dark,&rdquo; and of its intention,
&ldquo;dishing the Whigs,&rdquo; cannot be bettered. Whether Lord Derby
or Mr Disraeli originated this resolve has been much discussed,
and it remains an unsettled question. It is known that Disraeli&rsquo;s
private secretary, Mr Ralph Earle, quarrelled with him violently
at about this time; and Sir William Fraser relates that, meeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page568" id="page568"></a>568</span>
Mr Earle, that gentleman said: &ldquo;I know what your feelings must
be about this Reform Bill, and I think it right to tell you that it
was not Disraeli&rsquo;s bill, but Lord Derby&rsquo;s. I know everything
that occurred.&rdquo; Mr Earle gave the same assurances to the writer
of these lines, and did so with hints and half-confidences (quite
intelligible, however) as to the persuasions that wrought upon his
chief. Mr Earle&rsquo;s listener on these occasions confesses that he
heard with a doubting mind, and that belief in what he heard still
keeps company with Mahomet&rsquo;s coffin. One thing, however, is
clear. To suppose Disraeli satisfied with the excuses made for his
adoption of the &ldquo;dishing&rdquo; process is forbidden by the whole tenor
of his teaching and conduct. He could not have become suddenly
blind to the fallacy of the expectations derived from such a
course; and all his life it had been his distinction to look above
the transient and trafficking expedients of the professional
politician. However, the thing was done. After various
remodellings, and amid much perturbation, secession, violent
reproach, the Household Suffrage Bill passed in August 1867.
Another memorable piece of work, the confederation of Canada,
had already been accomplished. A few days after parliament met
<span class="sidenote">Premier, 1868.</span>
in the next year Lord Derby&rsquo;s failing health compelled
him to resign and Mr Disraeli became prime minister.
Irish disaffection had long been astir; the Fenian
menace looked formidable not only in Ireland but in England also.
The reconstructed government announced its intention of dealing
with Irish grievances. Mr Gladstone approved, proposing the
abolition of the Irish Church to begin with. A resolution to that
effect was immediately carried against the strong opposition of
the government. Disraeli insisted that the question should be
settled in the new parliament which the franchise act called for,
and he seems to have had little doubt that the country would
declare against Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s proposal. He was mistaken. It
was the great question at the polls; and the first elections by the
new constituencies went violently against the authors of their being.</p>

<p>The history of the next five years is Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s. The Irish
Church abolished, he set to work with passionate good intention
on the Irish land laws. The while he did so sedition took courage
and flourished exceedingly, so that to pacify Ireland the constable
went hand in hand with the legislator. The abolition of the Irish
Church was followed by a coercion act, and the land act by suspension
of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>. Disraeli, who at first preferred retirement
and the writing of <i>Lothair</i>, came forward from time to time
to point the moral and predict the end of Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s
impulsive courses, which soon began to fret the confidence of his
friends. Some unpleasant errors of conduct&mdash;the case of Sir R.
Collier (afterwards Lord Monkswell, <i>q.v.</i>), the Ewelme rectory
case,<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the significant Odo Russell
(Lord Ampthill) episode (to help the government out of a scrape
the ambassador was accused of exceeding his instructions)&mdash;told yet
more. Above all, many humiliating proofs that England was losing her
place among the nations came out in these days, the discovery being
then new and unendurable. To be brief, in less than four years the
government had well-nigh worn out its own patience with its own errors,
failures and distractions, and would gladly have gone to pieces
when it was defeated on an Irish university bill. But Disraeli,
having good constitutional reasons for declining office at the
moment, could not allow this. Still gathering unpopularity, still
offending, alarming, alienating, the government went on till 1874,
suddenly dissolved parliament, and was signally beaten, the
Liberal party breaking up. Like most of his political friends,
Disraeli had no expectation of such a victory&mdash;little hope, indeed,
of any distinct success. Yet when he went to Manchester on a
brief political outing two years before, he was received with such
acclaim as he had never known in his life. He was then sixty-eight
years old, and this was his first full banquet of popularity.
The elation and confidence drawn from the Manchester meetings
were confirmed by every circumstance of the 1874 elections. But
he was well aware of how much he owed to his opponents&rsquo; errors,
seeing at the same time how safely he could lay his future course
by them. He had always rejected the political economy of his
time, and it was breaking down. He had always refused to accept
the economist&rsquo;s dictum without reference to other considerations
than the turnover of trade; and even Manchester could pardon
the refusal now. The national spirit, vaporized into a cosmopolitan
mist, was fast condensing again under mortification and
insult from abroad uncompensated by any appreciable percentage
of cash profit. This was a changing England, and one that
Disraeli could govern on terms of mutual satisfaction; but not if
the reviving &ldquo;spirit of the country&rdquo; ran to extremes of self-assertion.
At one of the great Manchester meetings he said, &ldquo;Do
not suppose, because I counsel firmness and decision at the right
moment, that I am of that school of statesmen who are favourable
to a turbulent and aggressive diplomacy. I have resisted it
during a large part of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But for the hubbub occasioned by the Public Worship Regulation
Act, the first two years of the 1874 administration had no
remarkable excitements till near the end of them. The Public
Worship Act, introduced by the archbishop of Canterbury, was
meant to restrain ritualism. Disraeli, who from first to last held
to the Reformed Church as capable of dispensing social good
as no other organization might, supported the Bill as &ldquo;putting
down ritualism&rdquo;; spoke very vehemently; gave so much
offence that at one time neither the bill nor the government
seemed quite safe. For some time afterwards there was so little
legislation of the kind called &ldquo;enterprising&rdquo; that even some
friends of the government began to think it too tame; but at
the end of the second year an announcement was made which
put that fear to rest. The news that the khedive&rsquo;s Suez Canal
<span class="sidenote">Suez Canal shares.</span>
shares had been bought by the government was
received with boundless applause. It was a courageous
thing to do; but it was not a Disraeli conception, nor
did it originate in any government department. It was suggested
from without at a moment when the possibility of ever acquiring
the shares was passing away. On the morning of the 15th of
November 1875, Mr Frederick Greenwood, then editor of the
<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, went to Lord Derby at the foreign office,
informed him that the khedive&rsquo;s shares were passing into the
hands of a French syndicate, and urged arrest of the transaction
by purchase for England. (The shares being private property
their sale could not, of course, be forbidden.) Lord Derby
thought there must be a mistake. He could not believe that
bargaining of that kind could go on in Cairo without coming to
the knowledge of the British consul there. He was answered
that nevertheless it was going on. The difficulties of purchase
by England were then arrayed by Lord Derby. They were
more than one or two, and of course they had a formidable look,
but so also had the alternative and the lost opportunity. One
difficulty had already come into existence, and had to be met
at once. Lord Derby had either to make direct inquiry of the
khedive or to let the matter go. If he inquired, and there was
no such negotiation, his question might be interpreted in a very
troublesome way; moreover, we should put the idea of selling
the shares into the khedive&rsquo;s head, which would be unfortunate.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my position, and now what do you say?&rdquo; The
answer given, Lord Derby drafted a telegram to the British
consul-general at Cairo, and read it out. It instructed Colonel
Stanton to go immediately to the khedive and put the question
point blank. Meanwhile the prime minister would be seen, and
Lord Derby&rsquo;s visitor might call next day to hear the reply from
Cairo. It is enough to add here that on receipt of the answer
the purchase for England was taken up and went to a speedy conclusion.<a name="fa2g" id="fa2g" href="#ft2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>As if upon the impulse of this transaction, Disraeli opened
the next session of parliament with a bill to confer upon the
queen the title of empress of India&mdash;a measure which offended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page569" id="page569"></a>569</span>
the instincts of many Englishmen, and, for the time, revived
the prejudices against its author. More important was the
revival of disturbances in European Turkey, which, in their
outcome, were to fill the last chapter of Disraeli&rsquo;s career. But
for this interruption it is likely that he would have given much
of his attention to Ireland, not because it was an attractive
employment for his few remaining years, but because he saw
with alarm the gathering troubles in that country. And his
mind was strongly drawn in another direction. In a remarkable
speech delivered in 1872, he spoke with great warmth of the
slighting of the colonies, saying that &ldquo;no minister in this country
will do his duty who neglects any opportunity of reconstructing
as much as possible our colonial empire, and of responding to
those distant sympathies which may become the source of
incalculable strength and happiness to this island.&rdquo; However,
nothing was done in fulfilment of this duty in the first two years
<span class="sidenote">Eastern question.</span>
from 1874, and early in the third the famous Andrassy
note, the Berlin memorandum, the Bashi-Bazouk
atrocities, and the accumulative excitement thereby created
in England, reopened the Eastern question with a vengeance.
The policy which Disraeli&rsquo;s government now took up may be truly
called the national policy. Springing from the natural
suggestions of self-defence against the march of a dangerous
rivalry, it had the sanction of all British statesmanship for
generations, backed by the consenting instinct of the people.
It was quite unsentimental, being pro-Turkish or anti-Russian
only as it became so in being pro-British. The statesmen by
whom it was established and continued saw in Russia a power
which, unless firmly kept within bounds, would dominate Europe;
more particularly that it would undermine and supersede British
authority in the East. And without nicely considering the desire
of Russia to expand to the Mediterranean, the Pacific or in any
other direction, they thought it one of their first duties
to maintain their own Eastern empire; or, to put it another
way, to contrive that Great Britain should be subject to Russian
ascendancy (if ever), at the remotest period allowed by destiny.
Such were the ideas on which England&rsquo;s Russian policy was
founded. In 1876 this policy revived as a matter of course in
the cabinet, and as spontaneously, though not upon a first
provocation, became popular almost to fury. And furiously
popular it remained. But a strong opposing current of feeling,
equally passionate, set in against the Turks; war began and
lasted long; and as the agitation at home and the conflict
abroad went on, certain of Disraeli&rsquo;s colleagues, who were
staunch enough at the beginning, gradually weakened. It is
certainly true that Disraeli was prepared, in all senses of the
word, to take strong measures against such an end to the war
as the San Stefano treaty threatened. Rather than suffer that,
he would have fought the Russians in alliance with the Turks,
and had gone much farther in maturing a scheme of attack and
defence than was known at the time or is commonly known now.
That there was a master motive for this resolution may be taken
for granted; and it is to be found in a belief that not to throw
back the Russian advance then was to lose England&rsquo;s last chance
of postponing to a far future the predominance of a great rival
power in the East. How much or how little judgment shows
in that calculation, when viewed in the light of later days, we
do not discuss. What countenance it had from his colleagues
dropped away. At the end their voices were strong enough to
insist upon the diplomatic action which at no point falls back
on the sword; Lord Derby (foreign minister) being among the
first to make a stand on that resolution, though he was not the
first seceder from the government. Such diplomacy in such
conditions is paralytic. It cannot speak thrice, with whatever
affectation of boldness, without discovering its true character
to trained ears; which should be remembered when Disraeli&rsquo;s
successes at Berlin are measured. It should be remembered
that what with the known timidity of his colleagues, and what
with the strength and violence of the Russian party in England,
his achievement at Berlin was like the reclamation of butter
from a dog&rsquo;s mouth; as Prince Bismarck understood in acknowledging
Disraeli&rsquo;s gifts of statesmanship. It should also be
remembered, when his Eastern policy in 1876-1878 is denounced
as malign and a failure, that it was never carried out. Good or
bad, ill or well calculated, effective existence was denied to it;
and a man cannot be said to have failed in what he was never
permitted to attempt. The nondescript course of action which
began at the Constantinople conference and ended at Berlin
was not of his direction until its few last days. It only marked
at various stages the thwarting and suppression of his policy by
colleagues who were haunted night and day by memories of the
Crimean War, and not least, probably, by the fate of the statesmen
who suffered for its blunders and their own. Disraeli also
looked back to those blunders, and he was by no means insensible
to the fate of fallen ministers. But just as he maintained at the
time of the conflict, and after, that there would have been no
Crimean War had not the British government convinced the
tsar that it was in the hands of the peace party, so now he
believed that a bold policy would prevent or limit war, and at
the worst put off grave consequences which otherwise would
make a rapid advance.</p>

<p>As if aware of much of this, the country was well content with
Disraeli&rsquo;s successes at Berlin, though sore on some points, he
himself sharing the soreness. Yet there were great days for him
after his return. At the Berlin conference he had established a
formidable reputation; the popularity he enjoyed at home was
affectionately enthusiastic; no minister had ever stood in more
cordial relations with his sovereign; and his honours in every
kind were his own achievement against unending disadvantage.
But he was soon to suffer irretrievable defeat. A confused and
unsatisfactory war in Afghanistan, troubles yet more unsatisfactory
in South Africa, conspired with two or three years of
commercial distress to invigorate &ldquo;the swing of the pendulum&rdquo;
when he dissolved parliament in 1880. Dissolution the year
before would have been wiser, but a certain pride forbade. The
elections went heavily against him. He took the blow with
composure, and sank easily into a comparative retirement. Yet
he still watched affairs as a great party leader should, and from
time to time figured vigorously in debate. Meanwhile he had
another novel to sit down to&mdash;the poor though highly characteristic
<i>Endymion</i>; which, to his great surprise and equal pleasure,
was replaced on his table by a cheque for ten thousand pounds. Yet
even this satisfaction had its tang of disappointment; for though
<i>Endymion</i> was not wholly written in his last days, it was in
no respect the success that <i>Lothair</i> was. This also he could
bear. His description of his grandfather recurs to us: &ldquo;A man
of ardent character, sanguine, courageous and fortunate, with a
temper which no disappointment could disturb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As earl of Beaconsfield (failing health had compelled him to
take refuge in the House of Lords in 1876) Benjamin Disraeli died
in his house in Curzon Street on the 19th of April 1881. The
likelihood of his death was publicly known for some days before
the event, and then the greatness of his popularity and its
warmth were declared for the first time. No such demonstration
of grief was expected even by those who grieved the most. He
lies in Hughenden churchyard, in a rail-enclosed grave, with
liberty for the turf to grow between him and the sky. Within the
church is a marble tablet, placed there by his queen, with a
generous inscription to his memory. The anniversary of his death
has since been honoured in an unprecedented manner, the 19th of
April being celebrated as &ldquo;Primrose Day&rdquo;&mdash;the primrose, for
reasons impossible accurately to define, being popularly supposed
to have been Disraeli&rsquo;s favourite flower. Even among his friends
<span class="sidenote">Death and influence.</span>
in youth (Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer, for example), and
not improbably among the city men who wagered their
money in irrecoverable loans to him on the chance of
his success, there may have been some who compassed the
thought of Benjamin Disraeli as prime minister and peer; but at
no time could any fancy have imagined him remembered so enduringly
as Lord Beaconsfield has been. It is possible that Sarah Disraeli
(the Myra of <i>Endymion</i>), or that &ldquo;the most severe
of critics but a perfect wife,&rdquo; may have had such dreams&mdash;hardly
that they could have occurred to any mind but a devoted
woman&rsquo;s. Disraeli&rsquo;s life was a succession of surprises, but none
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page570" id="page570"></a>570</span>
was so great as that he should be remembered after death more
widely, lastingly, respectfully, affectionately, than any other
statesman in the long reign of Queen Victoria. While he lived he
did not seem at all cut out for that distinction even as an
Imperialist. Significant as was the common grief when he died, no
such consequence could be inferred from it, and certainly not
from the elections of 1880. It stands, however, this high distinction,
and with it the thought that it would have been denied to
him altogether had the &ldquo;adventurer&rdquo; and &ldquo;mystery man&rdquo; of
the sixties died at the age of threescore years and ten. We have
said that never till 1872 did he look upon the full cup of popularity.
It might have been said that even at that time intrigue
to get rid of him had yet to cease in his own party; and but a few
years before, a man growing old, he was still in the lowest deeps
of his disappointments and humiliations. How, then, could it be
imagined that with six years of power from his seventieth year,
the Jew &ldquo;adventurer,&rdquo; mysterious and theatrical to the last,
should fill a greater space in the mind of England twenty years
after death than Peel or Palmerston after five? Of course it can
be explained; and when explained, we see that Disraeli&rsquo;s good
fortune in this respect is not due entirely to his own merits. His
last years of power might have been followed by as long a period
of more acceptable government than his own, to the effacement
of his own from memory; but that did not happen. What did
follow was a time of universal turbulence and suspicion, in which
the pride of the nation was wounded again and again. To say
&ldquo;Majuba&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gordon&rdquo; recalls its deepest hurts, but not all
of them; and it may be that a pained and angry people, looking
back, saw in the man whom they lately displaced more than they
had ever seen before. From that time, at any rate, Disraeli has
been acknowledged as the regenerator and representative of the
Imperial idea in England. He has also been accused on the same
grounds; and if the giver of good wine may be blamed for the
guest who gets drunk on it, there is justice in the accusation. It
is but a statement of fact, however, that Disraeli retains his hold
upon the popular mind on this account mainly. The rekindling
of the Imperial idea is understood as a timely act of revolt and
redemption: of revolt against continuous humiliations deeply
felt, redemption from the fate of nations obviously weak and
suspected of timidity. It has been called rescue-work&mdash;deliverance
from the dangers of invited aggression and a philosophical
neglect of the means of defence. And its first achievement for
the country (this is again a mere statement of fact) was the
restoration of a much-damaged self-respect and the creation of a
great defensive fleet not a day too soon for safety. So much for
&ldquo;the great heart of the people.&rdquo; Meanwhile political students
find to their satisfaction that he never courted popularity, and
never practised the art of working for &ldquo;quick returns&rdquo; of
sympathy or applause. As &ldquo;adventurer,&rdquo; he should have done
so; yet he neglected the cultivation of that paying art for the
wisdom that looks to the long future, and bears its fruit, perchance,
when no one cares to remember who sowed the seed. So
it is that to read some of his books and many of his speeches is to
draw more respect and admiration from their pages than could
have been found there originally. The student of his life understands
that Disraeli&rsquo;s claim to remembrance rests not only on the
breadth of his views, his deep insight, his long foresight, but even
more on the courage which allowed him to declare opinions
supplied from those qualities when there was no visible likelihood
of their justification by experience, and therefore when their
natural fate was to be slighted. His judgments had to wait the
event before they were absolved from ridicule or delivered from
neglect. The event arrives; he is in his grave; but his reputation
loses nothing by that. It gains by regret that death was
beforehand with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adventurer,&rdquo; as applied to Disraeli, was a mere term of
abuse. &ldquo;Mystery-man&rdquo; had much of the same intention, but
in a blameless though not in a happy sense it was true of him to
the end of his days. Even to his friends, and to many near him,
he remained mysterious to the last. It is impossible to doubt
that some two or three, four or five perchance, were at home in
his mind, being freely admitted there; but of partial admissions
to its inner places there seem to have been few or none. Men
who were long associated with him in affairs, and had much of
his stinted companionship, have confessed that with every wish
to understand his character they never succeeded. Sometimes
they fancied they had got within the topping walls of the maze,
and might hope to gain the point whence survey could be made
of the whole; but as often they found themselves, in a moment,
where they stood at last and at first&mdash;outside. His speeches
carry us but a little way beyond the mental range; his novels
rather baffle than instruct. It is commonly believed that Disraeli
looked in the glass while describing Sidonia in <i>Coningsby</i>.
We group the following sentences from this description for a
purpose that will be presently seen:&mdash;(1) &ldquo;He was admired by
<span class="sidenote">Character.</span>
women, idolized by artists, received in all circles with
great distinction, and appreciated for his intellect by
the very few to whom he at all opened himself.&rdquo;
(2) &ldquo;For, though affable and generous, it was impossible to
penetrate him: though unreserved in his manners his frankness was
limited to the surface. He observed everything, thought ever,
but avoided serious discussion. If you pressed him for an opinion
he took refuge in raillery, and threw out some paradox with
which it was not easy to cope. The secret history of the world
was Sidonia&rsquo;s pastime. His great pleasure was to contrast the
hidden motive with the public pretext of transactions.&rdquo;
(3) &ldquo;He might have discovered a spring of happiness in
susceptibilities of the heart; but this was a sealed fountain for
Sidonia. In his organization there was a peculiar, perhaps a great
deficiency; he was a man without affection. It would be hard to say
that he had no heart, for he was susceptible of deep emotions;
but not for individuals. Woman was to him a toy, man a
machine.&rdquo; These sentences are separately grouped here for the
sake of suggesting that they will more truly illustrate Disraeli&rsquo;s
character if taken as follows:&mdash;The first as representing his most
cherished social ambitions&mdash;in whatever degree achieved. The
second group as faithfully and closely descriptive of himself;
descriptive too of a character purposely cloaked. The third as
much less simple; in part a mixture of truth with Byronic affectation,
and for the rest (and more significantly), as intimating
the resolute exercise of extraordinary powers of control over
the promptings and passions by which so many capable ambitions
have come to grief. So read, Sidonia and Benjamin Disraeli are
brought into close resemblance by Disraeli himself; for what in
this description is untrue to the suspected fundamentals of his
character is true to his known foibles. But for a general
interpretation of Lord Beaconsfield and his career none serves so
well as that which Froude insists on most. He was thoroughly
and unchangeably a Jew. At but one remove by birth from
southern Europe and the East, he was an Englishman in nothing
but his devotion to England and his solicitude for her honour
and prosperity. It was not wholly by volition and design that
his mind was strange to others and worked in absolute detachment.
He had &ldquo;none of the hereditary prepossessions of the
native Englishman.&rdquo; No such prepossessions disturbed his
vision when it was bent upon the rising problems of the time, or
rested on the machinery of government and the kind of men who
worked it and their ways of working. The advantages of
Sidonia&rsquo;s intellect and temperament were largely his, in affairs,
but not without their drawbacks. His pride in his knowledge
of the English character was the pride of a student; and we may
doubt if it ever occurred to him that there would have been less
pride but more knowledge had he been an Englishman. It is
certain that in shrouding his own character he checked the
communication of others to himself, and so could continue to
the end of his career the costly mistake of being theatrical in
England. There was a great deal too (though little to his blame)
in Lord Malmesbury&rsquo;s observation that he was not only disliked
in the House of Commons for his mysterious manner, but
prejudiced by a pronounced foreign air and aspect. Lord
Malmesbury does not put it quite as strongly as that, but he
might have done so with truth. No Englishman could approach
Disraeli without some immediate consciousness that he was in
the presence of a foreigner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page571" id="page571"></a>571</span></p>

<p>Lord Beaconsfield has been praised for his integrity in money
matters; the praise could have been spared&mdash;it does not rise
high enough. It is also said to his honour that he &ldquo;never
struck at a little man,&rdquo; and that was well; but it is explained
as readily by pride and calculation as by magnanimity. A man
of extraordinary coolness and self-control, his faults in every
kind were faults of excess: it is the mark of them all. But
whatever offence they gave, whatever mischief they did, was
soon exhausted, and has long since been pardoned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAD,<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> a small globule or ball used in necklaces, and made of
different materials, as metal, coral, diamond, amber, ivory, stone,
pottery, glass, rock-crystal and seeds. The word is derived from
the Middle Eng. <i>bede</i>, from the common Teutonic word for &ldquo;to
pray,&rdquo; cf. German <i>beten</i> and English <i>bedesman</i>, the meaning
being transferred from &ldquo;prayer&rdquo; to the spherical bodies strung on a
rosary and used in counting prayers. Beads have been made
from remote antiquity, and are found in early Egyptian tombs;
variegated glass beads, found in the ground in certain parts of
Africa, as Ashantiland, and highly prized by the natives as
<i>aggry</i>-beads, are supposed to be of Egyptian or Phoenician origin.
Beads of the more expensive materials are strung in necklaces
and worn as articles of personal adornment, while the cheaper
kinds are employed for the decoration of women&rsquo;s dress. Glass
beads have long been used for purposes of barter with savage
tribes, and are made in enormous numbers and varieties,
especially in Venice, where the manufacture has existed from at
least the 14th century. Glass, either transparent, or of opaque
coloured enamel (<i>smalti</i>), or having complex patterns produced
by the twisting of threads of coloured glass through a transparent
body, is drawn out into long tubes, from which the beads are
pinched off, and finished by being rotated with sand and ashes in
heated cylinders.</p>

<p>In architecture, the term &ldquo;bead&rdquo; is given to a small cylindrical
moulding, in classic work often cut into bead and reel.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEADLE,<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> also <span class="sc">Bedel</span> or <span class="sc">Bedell</span> (from A.S. <i>bydel</i>, from <i>beodan</i>,
to bid), originally a subordinate officer of a court or deliberative
assembly, who summoned persons to appear and answer charges
against them (see Du Cange, <i>supra tit. Bedelli</i>). As such, the
beadle goes back to early Teutonic times; he was probably
attached to the moot as its messenger or summoner, being under
the direction of the reeve or constable of the leet. After the
Norman Conquest, the beadle seems to have diminished in
importance, becoming merely the crier in the manor and forest
courts, and sometimes executing processes. He was also employed
as the messenger of the parish, and thus became, to a certain
extent, an ecclesiastical officer, but in reality acted more as
a constable by keeping order in the church and churchyard during
service. He also attended upon the clergy, the churchwardens
and the vestry. He was appointed by the parishioners in vestry,
and his wages were payable out of the church rate. From the
Poor Law Act of 1601 till the act of 1834 by which poor-law
administration was transferred to guardians, the beadle in
England was an officer of much importance in his capacity of
agent for the overseers. In all medieval universities the bedel
was an officer who exercised various executive and spectacular
functions (H. Rashdall, <i>Hist. of Universities in the Middle Ages</i>,
i. 193). He still survives in many universities on the continent
of Europe and in those of Oxford and Cambridge, but
he is now shorn of much of his importance. At Oxford there are
four bedels, representing the faculties of law, medicine, arts and
divinity. Their duties are chiefly processional, the junior or
sub-bedel being the official attendant on the vice-chancellor, before
whom he bears a silver mace. At Cambridge there are two, termed
esquire-bedels, who both walk before the vice-chancellor, bearing maces.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAK<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> (early forms <i>beke</i> and <i>becke</i>, from Fr. <i>bec</i>,
late Lat. <i>beccus</i>, supposed to be a Gaulish word; the
Celtic <i>bec</i> and <i>beq</i>, however, are taken from the English),
the horny bill of a bird, and so used of the horny ends of the
mandibles of the octopus, the duck-billed platypus and other animals;
hence the rostrum (<i>q.v.</i>) or ornamented prow of ancient war vessels.
The term is also applied, in classic architecture, to the pendent
fillet on the edge of the corona of a cornice, which serves as a drip,
and prevents the rain from flowing inwards.</p>

<p>The slang use of &ldquo;beak&rdquo; for a magistrate or justice of the peace has not
been satisfactorily explained. The earlier meaning, which lasted down to
the beginning of the 19th century, was &ldquo;watchman&rdquo; or &ldquo;constable.&rdquo; According
to <i>Slang and its Analogues</i> (J.S. Farmer and W.E. Henley, 1890), the
first example of its later use is in the name of &ldquo;the Blind Beak,&rdquo; which
was given to Henry Fielding&rsquo;s half-brother, Sir John Fielding (about 1750).
Thomas Harman, in his book on vagrants, <i>Caveat or Warening for commen
cursitors, Vulgarely called Vagabones</i>, 1573, explains <i>harmans
beck</i> as &ldquo;counstable,&rdquo; <i>harman</i> being the word for the stocks.
Attempts have been made to connect &ldquo;beak&rdquo; in this connexion with the Old
English <i>beag</i>, a gold torque or collar, worn as a symbol of
authority, but this could only be plausible on the assumption that
&ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; was the earlier significance of the word.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEALE, DOROTHEA<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> (1831-1906), English schoolmistress, was born on the
21st of March 1831 in London, her father being a physician of good family
and cultivated tastes. She had already shown a strong intellectual bent
and considerable force of character when in 1848 she was one of the first
to attend lectures at the newly opened Queen&rsquo;s College for Ladies,
London, and from 1849 to 1856 she herself took classes there. In 1857
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page572" id="page572"></a>572</span>
for a few months she became head teacher of the Clergy
Daughters&rsquo; school at Casterton, Westmoreland, but narrow
religious prejudices on the part of the governors led to her
retirement. In 1858 she was appointed principal of the Ladies
College at Cheltenham (opened 1854), then in very low water.
Her tact and strenuousness, backed by able financial management,
led to its success being thoroughly established by 1864,
and as the college increased in numbers new buildings were
erected from 1873 onwards. Under Miss Beale&rsquo;s headship it
grew into one of the great girls&rsquo; schools of the country, and its
development and example played an important part in the
revolution effected in regard to the higher education of women.
Miss Beale retained her post till her death on the 9th of November
1906. Strongly religious by nature, broad-minded and keenly
interested in all branches of culture, she exercised a far-reaching
influence on her pupils.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAM<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> (from the O. Eng. <i>béam</i>, cf. Ger. <i>Baum</i>, a tree, to which
sense may be referred the use of &ldquo;beam&rdquo; as meaning the rood
or crucifix, and the survival in certain names of trees, as hornbeam),
a solid piece of timber, as a beam of a house, of a plough,
a loom, or a balance. In the last case, from meaning simply the
cross-bar of the balance, &ldquo;beam&rdquo; has come to be used of the
whole, as in the expression &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s beam,&rdquo; or &ldquo;common
beam,&rdquo; which refers to the old English standard balance for
wholesale goods, for several hundred years in the custody of the
Grocers&rsquo; Company, London. As a nautical term, &ldquo;beam&rdquo; was
transferred from the main cross-timbers to the side of the ship;
thus &ldquo;on the weather-beam&rdquo; means &ldquo;to windward,&rdquo; and a
ship is said to be &ldquo;wide in the beam&rdquo; when she is wide
horizontally. The phrase &ldquo;to be on one&rsquo;s beam-ends,&rdquo; denoting a
position of extreme peril or helplessness, is borrowed from the
position of a ship which has heeled over so far as to stand on the
ends of her horizontal beams. The meaning of &ldquo;beam&rdquo; for
shafts or rays of light comes apparently from the use of the word
to translate the Latin <i>columna lucis</i>, a pillar of light.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEAN<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> (a common Teutonic word, cf. Ger. <i>Bohne</i>), the seed of
certain leguminous plants cultivated for food all over the world,
and furnished chiefly by the genera <i>Vicia, Phaseolus, Dolichos</i>
and others. The common bean, in all its varieties, as cultivated
in Britain and on the continents of Europe and America, is the
produce of <i>Vicia Faba</i>. The French bean, kidney bean, or
haricot, is the seed of <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>; but in India several
other species of this genus of plants are raised, and form no small
portion of the diet of the inhabitants. Besides these there are
numerous other pulses cultivated for the food both of man and
domestic animals, to which the name bean is frequently given.
The common bean is even more nutritious than wheat; and it
contains a very high proportion of nitrogenous matter under the
form of legumin, which amounts on an average to 24%. It is,
however, a rather coarse food, and difficult of digestion, and is
chiefly used to feed horses, for which it is admirably adapted.
In England French beans are chiefly, almost exclusively, used
in the green state; the whole pod being eaten as a table vegetable
or prepared as a pickle. It is wholesome and nutritious; and
in Holland and Germany the pods are preserved in salt by almost
every family for winter and spring use. The green pods are cut
across obliquely, most generally by a machine invented for the
purpose, and salted in barrels. When wanted for use they are
steeped in fresh water to remove the salt, and broiled or stewed
they form an agreeable addition to the diet at a time when no
other vegetable may be had.</p>

<p>The broad bean&mdash;<i>Vicia Faba</i>, or <i>Faba vulgaris</i>, as it is known
by those botanists who regard the slight differences which
distinguish it from the great majority of the species of the vetch
genus (<i>Vicia</i>) as of generic importance&mdash;is an annual which has
been cultivated fiom prehistoric times for its nutritious seeds.</p>

<p>The lake-dwellers of Switzerland, and northern Italy in the
bronze age cultivated a small-fruited variety, and it was grown
in ancient Egypt, though, according to Herodotus, regarded
by the priests as unclean. The ancient Greeks called it <span class="grk" title="kuamos">&#954;&#973;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>,
the Latins <i>faba</i>, but there is no suggestion that the plant is a
native of Europe. Alphonse de Candolle (<i>Origin of Cultivated
Plants</i>, p. 320) concludes that the bean was introduced into
Europe probably by the western Aryans at the time of their
earliest migrations. He suggests that its wild habitat was twofold
some thousands of years ago, one of the centres being to the
south of the Caspian, the other in the north of Africa, and that
its area has long been in process of diminution and extinction.
The nature of the plant favours this hypothesis, for its seed has
no means of dispersing itself, and rodents or other animals can
easily make prey of it; the struggle for existence which was
going against this plant as against maize would have gradually
isolated it and caused it to disappear, if man had not saved it by
cultivation. It was introduced into China a little before the
Christian era, later into Japan and more recently into India,
though it has been suggested that in parts of the higher Himalayas
its cultivation has survived from very ancient times. It
is a plant which will flourish in all ordinary good garden soil.
The seeds are sown about 4 in. apart, in drills 2½ ft. asunder for
the smaller and 3 ft. for the larger sorts. The soil should,
preferably, be a rather heavy loam, deeply worked and well
enriched. For an early crop, seeds may be sown in November,
and protected during winter in the same manner as early peas.
An early crop may also be obtained by dibbling in the seeds in
November, sheltering by a frame, and in February transplanting
them to a warm border. Successional crops are obtained by
sowing suitable varieties from January to the end of June. All
the culture necessary is that the earth be drawn up about the
stems. The plants are usually topped when the pods have set,
as this not only removes the black aphides which often settle
there, but is also found to promote the filling of the pods.</p>

<p>The following are some of the best sorts:&mdash;for early use,
Early Mazagan, Long-pod, Marshall&rsquo;s Early Prolific and Seville
Long-pod; for late use, Carter&rsquo;s Mammoth Long-pod and Broad
Windsor.</p>

<p>The horse-bean is a variety&mdash;var. <i>equina</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cultivation of Field-bean</i>.&mdash;Several varieties of <i>Vicia Faba</i>
(<i>e.g.</i> the horse bean, the mazagan, the tick bean, the winter
bean) are cultivated in the field for the sake both of the grain,
which is used as food for live-stock, and of the haulm, which
serves for either fodder or litter. They are best adapted for
heavy soils such as clays or clayey loams. The time for sowing
is from the end of January to the beginning of March, or in the
case of winter beans from the end of September to the middle
of November. The bean-crop is usually interposed between two
crops of wheat or some other cereal. If spring beans are to be
sown, the land after harvest is dressed with farmyard manure,
which is then ploughed in. In January the soil is levelled with
the harrows, and the seed, which should be hard and light brown
in colour, is drilled in rows from 15 to 24 in. apart at the rate
of from 2 to 2½ bushels to the acre and then harrowed in. The
alternative is to &ldquo;dibble&rdquo; the seed in the furrow left by the
autumn ploughing and cover it in with the harrows; or the
land may be ridged with the double-breasted plough, manure
deposited in the furrows and the seed sown broadcast, the ridges
being then split back so as to cover both manure and seed.
After the plant shows, horse-hoeing and hand-hoeing between
the rows is carried on so long as the plant is small enough to
suffer no injury therefrom. The routine of cultivation for
winter beans hardly differs from that described except as regards
the time of sowing.</p>

<p>Beans are cut when the leaf is fallen and the haulm is almost
black either with the fagging hook or the reaping machine, though
the stoutness of the stalks causes a severe strain on the latter
implement. They are tied and stocked, and are so left for a
considerable time before stacking. There is less fear of injury to
the crop through damp than in the case of other cereals. Their
value for feeding purposes increases in the stack, where they may
remain for a year or more before threshing. Pea and bean
weevils, both striped (<i>Sitones lineatus</i>) and spotted (<i>Sitones
crinitus</i>), and the bean aphis (<i>Aphis rumicis</i>), are noted pests of
the crop. Winter beans come to maturity earlier than the
spring-sown varieties, and are therefore strong enough to resist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page573" id="page573"></a>573</span>
the attacks of the aphis by the end of June, when it begins its
ravages. Field-beans yield from 25 to 35 bushels to the acre.</p>

<p><i>Phascolus vulgaris</i>, the kidney, French or haricot bean, an
annual, dwarf and bushy in growth, is widely cultivated in temperate,
sub-tropical and tropical regions, but is nowhere known as
a wild plant. It was long supposed to be of Indian origin, an idea
which was disproved by Alphonse de Candolle, who sums up the
facts bearing on its origin as follows:&mdash;<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> has not
been long cultivated in India, the south-west of Asia and Egypt,
and it is not certain that it was known in Europe before the discovery
of America. At the latter epoch the number of varieties
in European gardens suddenly increased, and all authors began
to mention them. The majority of the species of the genus exist
in South America, and seeds apparently belonging to the species
in question have been found in Peruvian tombs of an uncertain
date, intermixed with many species, all American. Hence it is
probable that the plant is of South American origin.</p>

<p>It is a tender annual, and should be grown in a rich light loamy
soil and a warm sheltered situation. The soil should be well
enriched with hot-bed dung. The earliest crop may be sown by
the end of March or beginning of April. If, however, the temperature
of the soil is below 45°, the beans make but little progress.
The main crops should be got in early in May; and a later
sowing may be made early in July. The earlier plantings may be
sown in small pots, and put in frames or houses, until they can be
safely planted out-of-doors. A light covering of straw or some
other simple shelter suffices to protect from late frosts. The seeds
should be covered 1½ or 2 in. deep, the distance between the rows
being about 2 ft., or for the dwarfest sorts 18 in., and that between
plants from 4 to 6 in. The pods may be used as a green vegetable,
in which case they should be gathered whilst they are so crisp as
to be readily snapped in two when bent; but when the dry seeds
are to be used the pods should be allowed to ripen. As the green
pods are gathered others will continue to be formed in abundance,
but if old seed-forming pods are allowed to remain the formation
of young ones will be greatly checked. There are numerous
varieties; among the best are Canadian Wonder, Canterbury
and Black Negro.</p>

<p><i>Phaseolus multiflorus</i>, scarlet runner, is nearly allied to <i>P.
vulgaris</i>, of which it is sometimes regarded as a variety, but
differs in its climbing habit. It is naturally perennial and has a
thick fleshy root, but is grown in Great Britain as a tender annual.
Its bright, generally scarlet flowers, arranged in long racemes, and
the fact that it will flourish in any ordinary good garden soil,
combine to make it a favourite garden plant. It is also of interest
as being one of the few plants that twine in a direction contrary
to the apparent motion of the sun. The seeds of the runner beans
should be sown in an open plot,&mdash;the first sowing in May, another
at the beginning of June, and a third about the middle of June.
In the London market-gardens they are sown 8 to 12 in. apart, in
4 ft. rows if the soil is good. The twining tops are pinched or cut
off when the plants are from 2 to 2½ ft. high, to save the expense
of staking. It is better, however, in private gardens to have the
rows standing separately, and to support the plants by stakes 6 or
7 ft. high and about a foot apart, the tops of the stakes being
crossed about one-third down. If the weather is dry when the
pods are forming abundantly, plenty of tepid water should be
supplied to the plants. In training the shoots to their supports,
they should be twined from right to left, contrary to the course
of the sun, or they will not lay hold. By frequently picking the
pods the plants are encouraged to form fresh blooms from which
pods may be picked until the approach of frost.</p>

<p>The ordinary scarlet runner is most commonly grown, but there
is a white-flowered variety which has also white seeds; this is
very prolific and of excellent quality. Another variety called
Painted Lady, with the flowers red and white, is very ornamental,
but not so productive. Carter&rsquo;s Champion is a large-podded
productive variety.</p>

<p>Another species <i>P. lunatus</i>, the Lima bean, a tall biennial with
a scimitar-shaped pod (whence the specific name) 2 to 3 in. long
containing a few large seeds, is widely cultivated in the warmer parts of the world.</p>

<p>The young pods of another leguminous climbing herb, <i>Dolichos
Lablab</i>, as well as the seeds, are widely used in the tropics, as we
use the kidney bean. The plant is probably a native of tropical
Africa, but is now generally cultivated in the tropics. The word
<i>Dolichos</i> is of Greek origin, and was used by Theophrastus for the
scarlet runner.</p>

<p>Another species, <i>D. biflorus</i>, is the horse gram, the seed of
which is eaten by the poorer class of natives in India, and is also,
as are the pods, a food for horses and cattle.</p>

<p>The Soy bean, <i>Glycine hispida</i>, was included by Linnaeus in
the genus <i>Dolichos</i>. It is extensively cultivated in China and
Japan, chiefly for the pleasant-flavoured seed from which is
prepared a piquant sauce. It is also widely grown in India,
where the bean is eaten, while the plant forms a valuable fodder;
it is cultivated for the latter purpose in the United States.</p>

<p>Other references to beans will be found under special headings,
such as <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Calabar Bean</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Locust-Tree</a></span>. There are also several
non-leguminous seeds to which the popular name bean is attached.
Among these may be mentioned the sacred Egyptian or Pythagorean
bean (<i>Nelumbium speciosum</i>), and the Ignatius bean
(probably <i>Strychnos multiflora</i>), a source of strychnine.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks and Romans made use of beans in gathering
the votes of the people, and for the election of magistrates. A
white bean signified absolution, and a black one condemnation.
Beans had a mysterious use in the <i>lemuralia</i> and <i>parentalia</i>,
where the master of the family, after washing his hands three
times, threw black beans over his head nine times, reiterating
the words &ldquo;I redeem myself and my family by these beans.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEAN-FEAST,<a name="ar168" id="ar168"></a></span> primarily an annual dinner given by an employer
to his workpeople, and then colloquially any jollification.
The phrase is variously derived. The most probable theory is
that which connects it with the custom in France, and afterwards
in Germany and England, of a feast on Twelfth Night, at which
a cake with a bean buried in it was a great feature. The bean-king
was he who had the good fortune to have the slice of cake in
which was the bean. This choosing of a king or queen by a bean
was formerly a common Christmas diversion at the English and
Scottish courts, and in both English universities. This monarch
was master of the revels like his congener the lord of misrule. A
clue to his original functions is possibly found in the old popular
belief that the weather for the ensuing twelve months was
determined by the weather of the twelve days from Christmas to
Twelfth Night, the weather of each particular month being prognosticated
from each day. Thus the king of the bean of Twelfth
Night may have originally reigned for the twelve days, his chief
duty being the performance of magical ceremonies for ensuring
good weather during the ensuing twelve months. Probably in
him and the lord of misrule it is correct to find the lineal descendant
of the old king of the Saturnalia, the real man who personated
Saturn and, when the revels ceased, suffered a real death in his
assumed character. Another but most improbable derivation for
bean-feast connects it with M.E. <i>bene</i> &ldquo;prayer,&rdquo; &ldquo;request,&rdquo; the
allusion being to the soliciting of alms towards the cost of their
Twelfth Night dinner by the workpeople.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAR,<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> properly the name of the European brown bear (<i>Ursus
arctus</i>), but extended to include all the members of the <i>Ursidae</i>,
the typical family of Arctoid carnivora, distinguished by their
massive bodies, short limbs, and almost rudimentary tails.
With the single exception of the Indian sloth-bear, all the species
have forty-two teeth, of which the incisors and canines closely
resemble those of purely carnivorous mammals; while the
molars, and especially the one known as the &ldquo;sectorial&rdquo; or
&ldquo;carnassial,&rdquo; have their surfaces tuberculated so as to adapt
them for grinding vegetable substances. As might have been
supposed from their dentition, the bears are omnivorous; but
most prefer vegetable food, including honey, when a sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page574" id="page574"></a>574</span>
supply of this can be had. The grizzly bear, however, is chiefly
carnivorous; while the polar bear is almost wholly so.</p>

<p>Bears are five-toed, and provided with formidable claws,
which are not retractile, and thus better fitted for digging and
climbing than for tearing. Most climb trees in a slow, lumbering
fashion, and, in descending, always come hind-quarters first.
The grizzly bear is said to lose this power of climbing in the
adult stage. In northern countries bears retire during the
winter into caves and the hollows of trees, or allow the falling
snow to cover them, and there remain dormant till the advent
of spring, about which time the female usually produces her
young. These are born naked and blind, and it is commonly
five weeks before they see, or become covered with hair. Before
hibernating the adults grow very fat, and it is by the gradual
consumption of this fat&mdash;known in commerce as bear&rsquo;s grease&mdash;that
such vital action as is necessary to the continuance of life
is sustained.</p>

<p>The bear family is widely distributed, being found in every
quarter of the globe except Australia, and in all climates, from
the highest northern latitudes yet reached by man to the warm
regions of India and Malaya. In the north-west corner of Africa
the single representative of the family found on that continent
occurs.</p>

<p>The polar or white bear (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>), common to the
Arctic regions of both hemispheres, is distinguished from the
other species by having the soles of the feet covered with close-set
hairs,&mdash;in adaptation to the wants of the creature, the bear
being thereby enabled to walk securely on slippery ice. In the
whiteness of its fur also, it shows such an assimilation in colour
to that of surrounding nature as must be of considerable service
in concealing it from its prey. The food of the white bear
consists chiefly of seals and fish, in pursuit of which it shows
great power of swimming and diving, and a considerable degree
of sagacity; but its food also includes the carcases of whales,
birds and their eggs, and grass and berries when these can be
had. That it can sustain life on a purely vegetable diet is proved
by instances on record of its being fed for years on bread only, in
confinement. These bears are strong swimmers, Sir Edward
Sabine having found one &ldquo;swimming powerfully 40 m. from
the nearest shore, and with no ice in sight to afford it rest.&rdquo;
They are often carried on floating ice to great distances, and to
more southern latitudes than their own, no fewer than twelve
Polar bears having been known to reach Iceland in this way
during one winter. The female always hibernates, but the male
may be seen abroad at all seasons. In bulk the white bear
exceeds most other members of the family, measuring nearly
9 ft. in length, and often weighing 1600 &#8468;.</p>

<p>Land bears have the soles of the feet destitute of hair, and
their fur more or less shaggy. On these the brown bear (<i>Ursus
arctus</i>,&mdash;<span class="grk" title="arktos">&#7940;&#961;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> of Aristotle) is found in one or other of its
varieties all over the temperate and north temperate regions of
the eastern hemisphere, from Spain to Japan. The fur is usually
brownish, but there are black, blackish-grey and yellowish
varieties. It is a solitary animal, frequenting the wooded parts
of the regions it inhabits, and living on a mixed diet of fruits,
vegetable, honey, fish and the smaller animals. In winter it
hibernates, concealing itself in some hollow or cavern. It does
not seek to attack man; but when baited, or in defence of its
young, shows great courage and strength, rising on its hind legs
and endeavouring to grasp its antagonist in an embrace. Bear-baiting,
till within comparatively recent times, was a favourite
sport throughout Europe, but, along with cock-fighting and
badger-baiting, has gradually disappeared before a more humane
civilization. It was a favourite pastime among the Romans,
who imported their bears from Britain, a proof that the animal
was then comparatively abundant in that country; indeed,
from reference made to it in early Scottish history, the bear does
not appear to have been extirpated in Britain before the end of
the 11th century. It is now found in greatest abundance in
Norway, Russia and Siberia, where hunting the bear is a favourite
sport, and where, when dead, its remains are highly valued.
Among the Kamchadales &ldquo;the skin of the bear,&rdquo; says a traveller,
&ldquo;forms their beds and their coverlets, bonnets for their heads,
gloves for their hands and collars for their dogs. The flesh and
fat are their dainties. Of the intestines they make masks or
covers for their faces, to protect them from the glare of the sun
in the spring, and use them as a substitute for glass, by extending
them over their windows. Even the shoulder-blades are said
to be put in requisition for cutting grass.&rdquo; In confinement the
brown bear is readily tamed; and advantage has been taken
of the facility with which it can sustain itself on the hind feet
to teach it to dance to the sound of music. It measures 4 ft. in
length, and is about 2½ ft. high. Of this species Crowther&rsquo;s
bear from the Atlas Mountains, the Syrian bear (<i>Ursus arctus
pyriacus</i>) and the snow or isabelline bear (<i>Ursus arctus isabellinus</i>)
of the Himalaya are local races, or at most subspecies.<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> American
naturalists regard the big brown bears of Alaska as a distinct
group. They range from Sitka to the extremity of the Alaskan
Peninsula, over Kodiak Island, and inland. Their distinctive
external features are their large size, light-brown colour, high
shoulders, massive heads of great breadth and shaggy coat.</p>

<p>The grizzly bear (<i>Ursus arctus horribilis</i>, formerly known as <i>U.
ferox</i>) is regarded by some naturalists as a distinct species and by
others as a variety of the brown bear, to which it is closely allied.
It was said to exceed all other American mammals in ferocity of
disposition and muscular strength. Stories were told of its
attacking the bison, and it has been reported to carry off the
carcase of a wapiti, weighing nearly 1000 &#8468;, for a considerable
distance to its den, there to devour it at leisure. It also eats fruit
and vegetables. Its fur is usually of a yellowish-brown colour,
coarse and grizzled, and of little value commercially, while its
flesh, unlike that of other bears, is uneatable even by the Indians.
The grizzly bear is now rare in the United States, save in the
Yellowstone Park and the Clearwater Mountains of Idaho,
though more common in British Columbia. Several geographical
races are recognized. The Tibet bear (<i>U. pruinosus</i>) is a
light-coloured small species.</p>

<p>The American black bear (<i>Ursus americanus</i>) occurs throughout
the wooded parts of the North American continent, whence it is
being gradually driven to make room for man. It is similar in
size to the brown bear, but its fur is of a soft even texture, and of
a shining black colour, to which it owes its commercial value. At
the beginning of the 19th century black bears were killed in
enormous numbers for their furs, which at that time were highly
valued. In 1803 the skins imported into England numbered
25,000, but the imports have since decreased to one-half of that
number. They are chiefly used for military accoutrements. This
is a timid animal, feeding almost solely on fruits, and lying
dormant during winter, at which period it is most frequently
killed. It is an object of superstitious reverence to the Indians,
who never kill it without apologizing and deploring the necessity
which impels them to do so.</p>

<p>The Himalayan black bear (<i>U. torquatus</i>) is found in the forest
regions ranging from the Persian frontier eastward to Assam.
The average length is about 5 ft.; there is no under-fur, and the
coat is smooth, black in colour, with the exception of a white
horseshoe-mark on the chest. It feeds chiefly on fruit and roots,
but kills sheep, goats, deer, ponies and cattle, and sometimes
devours carrion.</p>

<p>The small bruang or Malayan bear (<i>Ursus malayanus</i>) is of a
jet-black colour, with a white semilunar mark on the chest, and
attains a length of 4½ ft. Its food consists almost solely of
vegetables and honey, but the latter is its favourite food,&mdash;the
extreme length and pliability of the tongue enabling it to scoop
out the honeycombs from the hollows of trees. It is found in the
Malay Peninsula and Islands, and is readily tamed.</p>

<p>Not much larger than the Malay bear is the South American
spectacled bear of the Andes (<i>U. ornatus</i>), distinguished from all
the rest by the presence of a perforation in the lower end of the
humerus, and hence sometimes separated as <i>Tremarctus</i>. It is
black, with tawny rings round the eyes, and white cheeks, throat
and chest. A second race or species exists.</p>

<p>The sloth-bear (<i>Melursus labiatus</i> or <i>ursinus</i>) is distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page575" id="page575"></a>575</span>
by the absence of one pair of upper incisors, the small size of the
cheek-teeth and the very extensile character of the lips. It is
also known as the aswail and the honey-bear, the last name being
also given to the Malay bear and the kinkajou. It is about the
size of the brown bear, is covered with long, black hair, and of
extremely uncouth aspect. It inhabits the mountainous regions
of India, is readily tamed and is the bear usually exhibited by
the Hindu jugglers. The food consists of fruits, honey and
white ants.</p>

<p>Fossil remains of extinct bears first occur in strata of the
Pliocene age. Those of the great cave bear (<i>Ursus spelaeus</i>),
found abundantly in certain caverns of central Europe and Asia,
show that it must have exceeded in size the polar bear of the
present day. Its remains are also found in similar situations in
Britain associated with those of an allied species (<i>Ursus priscus</i>).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEAR-BAITING<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> and <b>BULL-BAITING,</b> sports formerly very
popular in England but now suppressed on account of their
cruelty. They took place in arenas built in the form of theatres
which were the common resort even of cultivated people. In the
bear-gardens, which are known to have existed since the time of
Henry II., the bear was chained to a stake by one hind leg or by
the neck and worried by dogs. Erasmus, writing (about 1500)
from the house of Sir Thomas More, spoke of &ldquo;many herds of
bears maintained in the country for the purpose of baiting.&rdquo;
Sunday was the favourite day for these sports. Hentzner,
writing in 1598, describes the bear-garden at Bankside as
&ldquo;another place, built in the form of a theatre, which serves for
the baiting of Bulls and Bears. They are fastened behind, and
then worried by great English bull-dogs, but not without great
risk to the dogs from the horns of the one and the teeth of the
other, and it sometimes happens they are killed upon the spot;
fresh ones are immediately supplied in the places of those that
are wounded or tired.&rdquo; He also describes the whipping of a
blinded bear, a favourite variation of bear-baiting. For a famous
baiting which took place before Queen Elizabeth in 1575 thirteen
bears were provided. Of it Robert Laneham (fl. 1575) wrote, &ldquo;it
was a sport very pleasant to see, to see the bear, with his pink
eyes, tearing after his enemies&rsquo; approach; the nimbleness and
wait of the dog to take his advantage and the force and experience
of the bear again to avoid his assaults: if he were bitten in one
place how he would pinch in another to get free; that if he were
taken once, then by what shift with biting, with clawing, with
roaring, with tossing and tumbling he would work and wind
himself from them; and when he was loose to shake his ears
twice or thrice with the blood and the slaver hanging about his
physiognomy.&rdquo; The famous &ldquo;Paris Garden&rdquo; in Southwark was
the chief bear-garden in London. A Spanish nobleman of the
time, who was taken to see a pony baited that had an ape tied to
its back, expressed himself to the effect that &ldquo;to see the animal
kicking amongst the dogs, with the screaming of the ape, beholding
the curs hanging from the ears and neck of the pony, is very
laughable.&rdquo; Butler describes a bear-baiting at length in the first
canto of his <i>Hudibras</i>.</p>

<p>The Puritans endeavoured to put an end to animal-baiting,
although Macaulay sarcastically suggested that this was &ldquo;not
because it gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure
to the spectators.&rdquo; The efforts of the Puritans seem, however,
to have had little effect, for we find the sport flourishing at the
Restoration; but the conscience of cultivated people seems to
have been touched, for Evelyn wrote in his <i>Diary</i>, under the date
of June 16th, 1670: &ldquo;I went with some friends to the bear-garden,
where was cock-fighting, dog-fighting, bear and bull baiting, it
being a famous day for all these butcherly sports, or rather
barbarous cruelties. The bulls did exceedingly well, but the
Irish wolf-dog exceeded, which was a tall greyhound, a stately
creature indeed, who beat a cruel mastiff. One of the bulls
tossed a dog full into a lady&rsquo;s lap, as she sat in one of the boxes
at a considerable height from the arena. Two poor dogs were
killed, and so all ended with the ape on horseback, and I most
heartily weary of the rude and dirty pastime, which I had not
seen, I think, in twenty years before.&rdquo; Steele also attacked
these cruel sports in the <i>Tatler</i>. Nevertheless, when the tsar
Nicholas I. visited England as cesarevich, he was taken to see a
prize-fight and a bull-baiting. In this latter form of the sport
the bull&rsquo;s nose was usually blown full of pepper to render him
the more furious. The bull was often allowed a hole in the
ground, into which to thrust his nose and lips, his most vulnerable
parts. Sometimes the bull was tethered, and dogs, trained
for the purpose, set upon him one by one, a successful attack
resulting in the dog fastening his teeth firmly in the bull&rsquo;s snout.
This was called &ldquo;pinning the bull.&rdquo; A sport called bull-running
was popular in several towns of England, particularly at Tutbury
and Stamford. Its establishment at Tutbury was due to John
of Gaunt, to whose minstrels, on the occasion of their annual
festival on August 16th the prior of Tutbury, for his tenure,
delivered a bull, which had his horns sawn off, his ears and tail
cut off, his nostrils filled with pepper and his whole body smeared
with soap. The minstrels gave chase to the bull, which became
the property of any minstrel of the county of Stafford who
succeeded in holding him long enough to cut off a lock of his hair.
Otherwise he was returned to the prior. At the dissolution of
the monasteries this tenure devolved upon the dukes of Devonshire,
who suppressed it in 1788. At Stamford the running took
place annually on November 13th, the bull being provided by
the butchers of the town, the townspeople taking part in the
chase, which was carried on until both people and beast were
exhausted, and ended in the killing of the bull. Certain rules
were strictly observed, such as the prohibition of carrying
sticks or staves that were shod with iron. The Stamford
bull-running survived well into the 19th century. Bear-baiting and
bull-baiting were prohibited by act of parliament in 1835.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEARD, WILLIAM HOLBROOK<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> (1825-1900), American
painter, was born on the 13th of April 1825 at Painesville, Ohio.
He studied abroad, and in 1861 removed to New York City,
where in 1862 he became a member of the National Academy
of Design. He was a prolific worker and a man of much
inventiveness and originality, though of modest artistic endowment.
His humorous treatment of cats, dogs, horses and monkeys,
generally with some human occupation and expression, usually
satirical, gave him a great vogue at one time, and his pictures
were largely reproduced. His brother, James Henry Beard
(1814-1893), was also a painter.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEARD<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> (A.S. <i>beard</i>, O.H. and Mod. Ger. <i>Bart</i>, Dan. <i>baard</i>,
Icel. <i>bar</i>, rim, edge, beak of a ship, &amp;c., O. Slav, <i>barda</i>, Russ.
<i>barodá</i>. Cf. Welsh <i>barf</i>, Lat. <i>barba</i>, though, according to the
<i>New English Dictionary</i>, the connexion is for phonetic reasons
doubtful). Modern usage applies this word to the hair grown
upon a man&rsquo;s chin and cheek. When the chin is shaven, what
remains upon the cheeks is called whiskers. &ldquo;Moustache&rdquo; or
&ldquo;moustaches&rdquo; describes the hair upon the upper lip. But the
words have in the past had less exact meaning. Beard has
stood alone for all these things, and whisker has in its time
signified what we now call moustache, as in the case of Robinson
Crusoe&rsquo;s great pair of &ldquo;Turkish whiskers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bearded races of mankind have ever held the beard in
high honour. It is the sign of full manhood; the lad or the
eunuch is beardless, and the bearded woman is reckoned a witch,
a loathsome thing to all ages. Also the beard shrinks from the
profane hand; a tug at the beard is sudden pain and dishonour.
The Roman senator sat like a carven thing until the wondering
Goth touched his long beard; but then he struck, although he
died for the blow. The future King John gave deadly offence
to the native chieftains, when visiting Ireland in 1185, by
plucking at their flowing beards.</p>

<p>David&rsquo;s ambassadors had their beards despitefully shaven by
a bold heathen. Their own king mercifully covered their shame&mdash;&ldquo;Tarry
ye at Jericho until your beards be grown&rdquo;&mdash;but war
answered the insult. The oath on the beard is as old as history,
and we have an echo of it in the first English political ballad
when Sir Simon de Montfort swears &ldquo;by his chin&rdquo; revenge on
Warenne.</p>

<p>Adam, our first father, was by tradition created with a beard:
Zeus Allfather is bearded, and the old painters and carvers who
hardily pictured the first person of the Trinity gave Him the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page576" id="page576"></a>576</span>
long beard of his fatherhood. The race-fathers have it and the
ancient heroes. Abraham and Agamemnon, Woden and King
Arthur and Charlemagne, must all be bearded in our pictures.
With the Mahommedan peoples the beard as worn by an unshaven
prophet has ever been in high renown, the more so that
amongst most of the conquering tribes who first acknowledged
the unity of God and prophethood of Mahomet it grows freely.
But before Mahomet&rsquo;s day, kings of Persia had plaited their
sacred beards with golden thread, and the lords of Nineveh had
curiously curled and oiled beards such as their winged bull wears.
Bohadin tells us that Saladin&rsquo;s little son wept for terror when
he saw the crusaders&rsquo; envoys &ldquo;with their clean-shaven chins.&rdquo;
Selim I. (1512-1521) comes down as a Turkish sultan who broke
into holy custom and cut off his beard, telling a remonstrating
Mufti that his vizier should now have nothing to lead him by.
But such tampering with tradition has its dangers, and the
absolute rule of Peter the Great is made clear when we know
that he taxed Russian beards and shaved his own, and yet died
in his bed. Alexander the Great did as much and more with his
well-drilled Macedonians, and was obeyed when he bade them
shave off the handle by which an enemy could seize them.</p>

<p>With other traditions of their feudal age, the Japanese nation
has broken with its ancient custom of the razor, and their
emperor has beard and moustache; a short moustache is common
amongst Japanese officers and statesmen, and generals and
admirals of Nippon follow the imperial example. The Nearer
East also is abandoning the full beard, even in Mahommedan
lands. Earlier shahs of the Kajar house have glorious beards
below their girdles, but Ná&#7779;iru&rsquo;d-Dín and his successor have
shaved their chins. In later years the sultan of Turkey has
added a beard to his moustache; the khedive of Egypt, son of
a bearded father, has a soldier&rsquo;s moustache only. In Europe
the great Russian people is faithful to the beard, Peter&rsquo;s law
being forgotten. The tsar Alexander III.&rsquo;s beard might have
satisfied Ivan the Terrible, whose hands played delightedly
with the five-foot beard of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s agent George
Killingworth. Indeed the royal houses of Europe are for the
most part bearded or whiskered. It may be that the race of
Olivier le Dain, of the man who can be trusted with a sharp
razor near a crowned king&rsquo;s throat, is extinct. Leopold II.,
king of the Belgians, however, was in 1909 the only sovereign
with the full beard unclipped. The Austrian emperor, Francis
Joseph, retained the moustache and whiskers of the &rsquo;sixties, and
the German emperor, William II., for a short period,
commemorated by a few very rare photographs, had a beard,
although it was never suffered to reach the length of that beard
which gave his father an air of Charlemagne or Barbarossa. In
France bearded presidents have followed each other, but it may
be noted that the waxed moustache and &ldquo;imperial&rdquo; beard of
the Second Empire is now all but abandoned to the Frenchman
of English comedy. The modern English fashion of shaving
clean is rare in France save among actors, and during 1907
many Parisian waiters struck against the rule which forbade
them to grow the moustache.</p>

<p>For the most part the clergy of the Roman obedience shave
clean, as have done the popes for two centuries and more. But
missionary bishops cultivate the long beard with some pride, and
the orders have varying customs, the Dominican shaving and the
Franciscan allowing the hair to grow. The Roman Catholic
clergy of Dalmatia, secular and regular, are allowed to wear the
moustache without beard or whiskers, as a concession to national
prejudices.</p>

<p>Amongst English people, always ready to be swayed by fashion,
the hair of the face has been, age by age, cherished or shaved
away, curled or clipped into a hundred devices. Before the
immigration from Sleswick the Briton knew the use of the razor,
sometimes shaving his chin, but leaving the moustaches long.
The old English also wore moustaches and forked beards, but,
save for aged men, the beard had passed out of fashion before the
Norman Conquest. Thus, in the Bayeux needlework, Edward
the king is venerable with a long beard, but Harold and his
younger fighting men have their chins reaped. &ldquo;The English,&rdquo;
says William of Malmesbury, &ldquo;leave the upper lip unshaven,
suffering the hair continually to increase,&rdquo; and to Harold&rsquo;s spies
the Conqueror&rsquo;s knights, who had &ldquo;the whole face with both lips
shaven,&rdquo; were strange and priest-like. Matthew Paris had a
strange idea that the beard was distinctive of Englishmen; he
asserts that those who remained in England were compelled to
shave their beards, while the native nobles who went into exile
kept their beards and flowing locks &ldquo;like the Easterns and
especially the Trojans.&rdquo; He even believed that &ldquo;William with
the beard,&rdquo; who headed a rising in London under Richard I.,
came of a stock which had scorned to shave, out of hatred for the
Normans, a statement which Thierry developed.</p>

<p>The <i>Chanson de Roland</i> shows us &ldquo;the pride of France&rdquo; as
&ldquo;that good bearded folk,&rdquo; with their beards hanging over coats
of mail, and it makes the great emperor swear to Naimes by his
beard. It was only about the year 1000, according to Rodolf
Glaber, that men began in the north of France to wear short hair
and shave &ldquo;like actors&rdquo;; and even in the Bayeux tapestry the
old Norman shipwrights wear the beard. But so rare was hair on
the face amongst the Norman invaders that William, the forefather
of the Percys, was known in his lifetime and remembered
after his death as William &ldquo;Asgernuns&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oht les gernuns,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;William with the moustaches,&rdquo; the epithet revived by one
of his descendants making our modern name of Algernon. Count
Eustace of Boulogne was similarly distinguished. Fashion swung
about after the Conquest, and, in the day of Henry I., Serle the
bishop could compare bearded men of the Norman-English court
with &ldquo;filthy goats and bristly Saracens.&rdquo; The crusades, perhaps,
were accountable for the beards which were oddly denounced as
effeminate in the young courtiers of William Rufus. Not only
the Greeks but the Latins in the East sometimes adopted the
Saracen fashion, and the siege of Antioch (1098) was as unfavourable
to the use of the razor as that of Sevastopol. When the
Latins stormed the town by night, bearded knights owed their
death to the assumption that every Christian would be a shaven
man. But for more than four centuries diversity is allowed,
beards, moustaches and shaven faces being found side by side,
although now and again one fashion or another comes uppermost
to be followed by those nice in such matters. Henry II. is a close-shaven
king, and Richard II.&rsquo;s effigy shows but a little tuft on
each side of the chin, tufts which are two curled locks on the chin
of Henry IV. But Henry III. is long-bearded, Edward II. curls
his beard in three great ringlets, and the third Edward&rsquo;s long
forked beard flows down his breast in patriarchal style. The
mid-13th century, as seen in the drawings attributed to Matthew
Paris, is an age of many full and curled beards, although the
region about the lips is sometimes clipped or shaved. The beard
is common in the 14th century, the forked pattern being favoured
and the long drooping moustache. Amongst those who ride with
him to Canterbury, Chaucer, a bearded poet, notes the merchant&rsquo;s
&ldquo;forked beard,&rdquo; the white beard of the franklin and the red beard
of the miller, but the reeve&rsquo;s beard is &ldquo;shave as ny as ever he
can.&rdquo; Henry of Monmouth and his son are shaven, and thereafter
beards are rare save with a few old folk until they come
slowly back with the 16th century. In Ireland the statute
enacted by a parliament at Trim in 1447 recited that no manner
of man who will be taken for an Englishman should have beard
above his mouth&mdash;the upper lip must be shaven at least every
fortnight or be of equal growth with the nether lip,&mdash;and this
statute remained unrepealed for nigh upon two hundred years.
Henry VIII., always a law to himself, brought back the beard to
favour, Stowe&rsquo;s annals giving 1535 as the year in which he caused
his beard &ldquo;to be knotted and no more shaven,&rdquo; his hair being
polled at the same time. Many portraits give his fashion of
wearing a thin moustache, whose ends met a short and squarely
trimmed beard parted at the chin, a fashion in which he was
followed by his brother-in-law Charles Brandon. But it is
remarkable that those about him rarely imitated their most dread
sovereign. While Cromwell and Howard the Admiral go clean
shaven, the Seymour brothers, Denny and Russell, have the
beard long and flowing. Even the forty shilling a year man, says
Hooper in 1548, will waste his morning time while he sets his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page577" id="page577"></a>577</span>
beard in order. About this time the clergy began to break with
the long tradition of smooth faces. A priest in 1531 is
commanded to abstain from wearing a beard, and Cardinal Pole,
coming from the court of a bearded pope, appears bearded like a
Greek patriarch. The law too, the church&rsquo;s kinswoman, begins
to forbid, a sign of the change, and from 1542 the society of
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn makes rules for fining and expelling those who
appear bearded at their mess, rules which the example of exalted
lawyers caused to be withdrawn in 1560.</p>

<p>The age of Elizabeth saw lawyers, soldiers, courtiers and
merchants all bearded. Her Cecils, Greshams, Raleighs, Drakes,
Dudleys and Walsinghams have the beard. A shaven chin such
as that seen in the portrait of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, is
rare, but the beards take a hundred fashions, and satirists and
Puritan pamphleteers were busy with them and with the men
who wasted hours in perfuming or starching them, in dusting
them with orris powder, in curling them with irons and quills.
Stubbs gives them a place amongst his abuses. &ldquo;It is a world to
consider how their mowchatowes must be preserved or laid out
from one cheek to another and turned up like two horns towards
the forehead.&rdquo; Of the English variety of beards Harrison has a
good word: &ldquo;beards of which some are shaven from the chin
like those of Turks, not a few cut short like to the beard of
Marquess Otto, some made round like a rubbing brush, others
with a <i>pique de vant</i> (O! fine fashion) or now and then suffered to
grow long, the barbers being grown to be so cunning in this behalf
as the tailors. And therefore if a man have a lean and straight
face, a Marquess Otto&rsquo;s cut will make it broad and large; if it
be platter-like, a long slender beard will make it seem the
narrower; if he be weasel-becked, then much hair left on the
cheeks will make the owner look big like a bowdled hen, and as
grim as a goose, if Cornelis of Chelmersford say true.&rdquo; Nevertheless
he adds that &ldquo;many old men do wear no beards at all.&rdquo; The
Elizabethan fashions continued under King James, the beard
trimmed to a point being common wear; but under King
Charles there is a certain reaction, and the royal style of shaving
the cheeks and leaving the moustache whose points sweep upward
and the chin beard like a downward flame is followed by most
of the gentry. With some the beard disappears altogether or
remains a mere fleck below the lip. Archbishop Laud has a
cavalier-like chin tuft and upturned moustache, but Abbot his
predecessor wore the spade beard, the &ldquo;cathedral beard&rdquo; of
Randle Holme, seen in all its dignity on the Chigwell brass of
Samuel Harsnett, archbishop of York (died 1631), a grim figure
with his angry moustache and a long and broad beard, cut square
at the bottom.</p>

<p>From the Restoration year the razor comes more into use.
Young men shave clean. The restored king curls a few dark hairs
of a moustache over each cheek, but his brother James is shaven.
With the reign of Queen Anne the country enters the beardless
age, and beards, moustaches and whiskers are no more seen. In
the 18th century the moustache indicated a soldier from beyond
sea. A Jew or a Turk was known by the beard, an appendage
loathsome as comic. Matthew Robinson, the second Lord Rokeby,
was indeed wearing a beard in 1798, but he was reckoned a madman
therefor, and Phillips&rsquo;s <i>Public Character</i> pictures him as
&ldquo;the only peer and perhaps the only gentleman of either Great
Britain or Ireland who is thus distinguished.&rdquo; That George III.
in his madness should have been left unshaved was a circumstance
of his misery that wrung the hearts of all loyal folk. But in the
very year of 1798, when Lord Rokeby&rsquo;s image was engraved for
the curious, the Worcestershire militia officers quartered near
Brighton were copying the Austrian moustache of the foreign
troops, and we may note that the hair of the face, which
disappeared when wigs came in, began to reappear as wigs went out.
Early in the 19th century the bucks began to show a patch of
whisker beside the ear, and the soldier&rsquo;s moustache became a
common sight. Before Waterloo, guardsmen were complaining
that officers of humbler regiments imitated their fashion of the
moustache, and by the Waterloo year most young cavalry
officers were moustached. The Horse Artillery were the next
moustached corps, the rest of the army, already whiskered,
following their example in the &rsquo;fifties. But for a civilian to grow
a moustache was long reckoned a piece of unseemly swagger.
Clive Newcome, it will be remembered, wore one until the
taunting question whether he was &ldquo;going in the Guards&rdquo; shamed
him into shaving clean. When in 1840 Mr George Frederick
Muntz appeared in parliament with a full beard there were those
who felt that this tall Radical had taken his own strange method
of insulting English parliamentary institutions. James Ward,
R.A. (d. 1859), painter of animals, was another breaker of the
unwritten law, defending his beard in a pamphlet of eighteen
arguments as a thing pleasing at once to the artist and to his
Creator. Freedom in these matters only came when the troops
were home from the Crimea, when officers who had grown beards
and acquired the taste for tobacco during the long months in the
trenches showed their beards and their cigars in Piccadilly. Then
came the Volunteer movement, and every man was a soldier,
taking a soldier&rsquo;s licence. The dominant fashion was the
moustache, worn with long and drooping whiskers. But the
&ldquo;Piccadilly weepers&rdquo; of the &rsquo;sixties were out of the mode for
the younger men when the &rsquo;eighties began, and by the end of the
century whiskers were seen in the army only upon a few veteran
officers. The fashion of clean shaving had made some way, the
popularity of the shaven actor having a part in this. In 1909 all
modes of dealing with the hair of the face might be recognized,
but the full beard had become somewhat rare in England and the
full whiskers rarer still. The upper class showed an inclination
to shave clean, although the army grudgingly recognized a rule
which ordered the moustache to be worn. Naval men, by
regulation, shaved or wore both beard and moustache, but their
beards were always trimmed. Most barristers shaved the lips,
although the last judge unable to hear an advocate whose voice a
moustache interrupted had left the bench. Clergymen followed
the lay fashions as they did under the first Stuart kings, although
there was still some prejudice against the moustache as an
ornament military and inappropriate. A newspaper of 1857,
describing the appearance of Livingstone the missionary at a
Mansion House meeting, records that he came wearing a
moustache, &ldquo;braving the prejudices of his countrymen and thus
evincing a courage only inferior to that exhibited by him amongst
the savages of Central Africa.&rdquo; Even as late as 1884 the <i>Pall
Mall Gazette</i> has some surprised comments on the beard of Bishop
Ryle, newly consecrated to the see of Liverpool.</p>

<p>The footman, whose full-dress livery is the court dress of a
hundred years ago, must show no more than the rudimentary
whisker of the early eighteen-hundreds, and butler, coachman
and groom come under the same rule. The jockey and the hunt
whip are shaven likewise, but the courier has the whiskers and
moustache that once marked him as a foreigner in the English
milor&rsquo;s service, and the chauffeur, a servant with no tradition
behind him, is often moustached.</p>

<p>Lastly, we may speak of the practice of the royal house since
England came out of the beardless century. The regent took
the new fashion, and sat &ldquo;in whiskered state,&rdquo; but his brother
and successor shaved clean and disliked even the hussar&rsquo;s
moustache. The prince consort wore the moustache as a young
man, adding whiskers in later years. King Edward VII. wore
moustache and trimmed beard, and his heir apparent also
followed the fashion of many fellow admirals.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEARDSLEY, AUBREY VINCENT<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> (1872-1898), English
artist in black and white, was born at Brighton on the 24th of
August 1872. In 1883 his family settled in London, and in the
following year he appeared in public as an &ldquo;infant musical
phenomenon,&rdquo; playing at several concerts with his sister. In
1888 he obtained a post in an architect&rsquo;s office, and afterwards
one in the Guardian Life and Fire Insurance Company (1889).
In 1891, under the advice of Sir Edward Burne-Jones and Puvis
de Chavannes, he took up art as a profession. In 1892 he
attended the classes at the Westminster School of Art, then under
Professor Brown; and from 1893 until his death, at Mentone, on
the 16th of March 1898, his work came continually before the
public, arousing a storm of criticism and much hostile feeling.
Beardsley had an unswerving tendency towards the fantastic of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page578" id="page578"></a>578</span>
the gloomier and &ldquo;unwholesome&rdquo; sort. His treatment of most
subjects was revolutionary; he deliberately ignored proportion
and perspective, and the &ldquo;freedom from convention&rdquo; which he
displayed caused his work to be judged with harshness. In
certain phases of technique he especially excelled; and his earlier
methods of dealing with the single line in conjunction with masses
of black are in their way unsurpassed, except in the art of Japan,
the country which probably gave his ideas some assistance. He
was always an ornamentist, rather than an illustrator; and his
work must be judged from that point of view. His frontispiece
to <i>Volpone</i> is held by some to be, from this purely technical
standpoint, one of the best pen-drawings of the age. His posters
for the Avenue theatre and for Mr Fisher Unwin were among the
first of the modern cult of that art.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The following are the chief works which are illustrated with
drawings by Beardsley: the <i>Bon Mot</i> Library, <i>The Pall Mall
Budget</i>, and <i>The Studio</i> (1893), Sir Thomas Malory&rsquo;s <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>
(1893-1894), <i>Salomé</i> (1894), <i>The Yellow Book</i> (1894-1895), <i>The Savoy

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEARDSTOWN,<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> a city of Cass county, Illinois, U.S.A., in the
W. part of the state, on the E. bank of the Illinois river, about
111 m. N. of St Louis, Missouri. It is served by the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio South-Western, and the Burlington (Chicago, Burlington
&amp; Quincy) railways, and by steamboats plying between it and
St. Louis. Pop. (1890) 4226; (1900) 4827 (444 foreign-born);
(1910) 6107. The industrial establishments of the city include
flour, planing and saw mills, the machine shops (of the St Louis
division) of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railway, ice
factories, pearl button factories and a shoe factory. The fishing
interests are also important. Beardstown was laid out in 1827
and was incorporated as a city in 1896. It was named in honour
of Thomas Beard, who settled in the vicinity in 1820. During
the Black Hawk War (1832) it was a base of supplies for the
Illinois troops. The old court house in which Abraham Lincoln,
in 1854, won his famous &ldquo;Armstrong murder case,&rdquo; is now used
for a city hall.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEARER,<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> strictly &ldquo;one who carries,&rdquo; a term used in India
for a palanquin-bearer, and now especially for a body-servant.
The term is also used in connexion with military ambulances,
and &ldquo;bearer&rdquo; companies formed part of the Royal Army
Medical Corps until amalgamated with the field-hospitals to
form field-ambulances (1905). In banking and commerce the
word is applied to the holder or presenter of a cheque or draft
not made payable to a specific person; it has also a technical
use, as in printing, of anything that supports pressure in
machinery, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEARINGS<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span>. In engineering a &ldquo;bearing&rdquo; is that particular
kind of support which, besides carrying the load imposed upon
it by the shaft associated with it, allows the shaft freedom
to revolve. Or, put in another way, a bearing forms with the
shaft a pair of elements having one degree of freedom to turn
relatively to one another about their common axis. The part
of the shaft in the bearing is commonly called the <i>journal</i>. The
component parts of a small bearing, pillow block, plummer
block or pedestal, as it is variously styled, are illustrated in
fig. 1, and these parts, put together, are further illustrated in
fig. 2 with the shaft added. Corresponding parts are similarly
lettered in the two illustrations. The shaft (S) is encircled by the
<i>brasses</i> (B<span class="su">1</span> and B<span class="su">2</span>) made of gun metal, phosphor bronze or other
suitable material. The lower brass fits into the main casting
(A) in the semicircular seat provided for it, and is prevented from
moving endways by the flanges (F, F) and from turning with the
shaft by the projections (P, P), which fit into corresponding
recesses in the casting (A), one of which is shown at <i>p</i>. After the
shaft has been placed in position, the upper brass (B<span class="su">2</span>) and the
cap (C) are put on and both are held in place by the bolts (Q<span class="su">1</span>, Q<span class="su">2</span>).
The brasses are bedded into the main casting (A) and the cap (C)
respectively at the surfaces D, D, D, D. The complete bearing
is held to the framework of the machine by bolts (R<span class="su">1</span>, R<span class="su">2</span>) passing
through holes (H, H) which are slotted to allow endwise adjustment
of the whole bearing in order to facilitate the alignment of
the shaft. Oil or other lubricant is introduced through the hole
(G), and it passes
through the top
brass to grooves
or oilways cut into
the surface of the
brass for the purpose
of distributing
the oil uniformly to
the journal.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 410px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.</td></tr></table>

<p>Some form of
lubricator is usually
fitted at G in order
to supply oil to the
bearing continuously.
A form of
lubricator used for
this purpose is
shown in place, fig.
2, and an enlarged
section is shown in
fig. 3. It will be
seen that the lubricator
consists essentially of a cup the base of which is pierced
centrally by a tube which reaches to within a small distance of
the lid of the cup inside, and projects into the oilway leading
to the journal outside. The annular space round the tube inside
is filled with oil which is transferred to the central tube and
thence to the bearing by the capillary action of a cotton wick
thrust down on a piece of wire. It is only necessary to withdraw
the wick from the central tube to stop the supply of oil.
The lubricator is fitted through a hole in the lid which is usually
plugged with a piece of cane or closed by more elaborate means.
A line of shafting would be supported by several bearings of the
kind illustrated, themselves supported by brackets projecting
from or rigidly fixed to the walls of the workshop, or on frames
resting on the floor, or on hangers attached to the roof girders
or principals.</p>

<p>In bearings of modern design for supporting a line shaft the
general arrangement shown in fig. 1 is modified so that the
alignments of the shaft can be made both vertically or horizontally
by means of adjusting screws, and the brass is jointed with
the supporting main body so that it is free to follow the small
deflections of the shaft which take place when the shaft is working.
Another modern improvement is the formation
of an oil reservoir or well in the base of the
bearing itself, and the transference of the oil from
this well to the shaft by means of one or two rings
riding loosely on the shaft. The bottom part of
the ring dips into the oil contained in the well of
the bearing and, as the shaft rotates, the ring rolls
on the shaft and thus carries oil up to the shaft
continuously, from which it finds its way to the surfaces
of the shaft and bearing in contact. It should be
understood that the upper brass is slotted crossways to allow
the ring to rest on the shaft. When the direction of the load
carried by the bearing is constant it is unnecessary to provide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page579" id="page579"></a>579</span>
more than one brass, and the construction is modified accordingly.
Figs. 4 and 5 show an axle box used for goods wagons on the
Great Eastern railway, and they also illustrate the method of
pad lubrication in general use for this kind of bearing. The
main casting, A, is now uppermost, and is designed so that the
upper part supports and constrains the spring buckle through
which the load W is transmitted to the bearing, and the lower
part inside is arranged to support the brass, B. The brass is
jointed freely with the main casting by means of a hemispherical
hump resting in a corresponding recess in the casting. What
may be called the cap, C, forms the lower part of the axle box,
but instead of supporting a second brass it is formed into an oil
reservoir in which is arranged a pad of cotton wick woven on a
tin frame. The upper part of the pad is formed into a kind of
brush, shaped to fit the underside of the journal, whilst the lower
part consists of streamers of wick resting in the oil. The oil is
fed to the brush by the capillary action of the streamers. The
reservoirs are filled with oil through the apertures P and O.
The bottom cap is held in position by the T-headed bolts
Q<span class="su">1</span> and Q<span class="su">2</span> (fig. 5). By slackening the nuts and turning the T-heads
fair with the slots in the cap, the cap comes right away
and the axle may be examined. A leather ring L is fitted as
shown to prevent dust from entering the axle box.</p>

<p><i>Footsteps</i>.&mdash;A bearing arranged to support the lower end of
a vertical shaft is called a footstep, sometimes a pivot bearing.
A simple form of footstep is shown in fig 6. A casting A,
designed so that it can be conveniently bolted to a foundation
block, cross beam, or bracket is bored out and fitted with a
brass B, which is turned inside to carry the end of the shaft S.
The whole vertical load on the shaft is carried by the footstep,
so that it is important to arrange efficient lubricating apparatus.
Results of experiments made on a footstep, reported in <i>Proc.
Inst. Mech. Eng.</i>, 1891, show that if a diametral groove be cut
in the brass, as indicated at <i>g</i> (fig 6), and if the oil is led to the
centre of this groove by a channel <i>c</i> communicating with the
exterior, the rotation of the shaft draws in a plentiful supply of
oil which radiates from the
centre and makes its way
vertically between the shaft
and the brass and finally
overflows at the top of the
brass. The overflowing oil
may be led away and may
be re-introduced into the
footsteps at <i>c</i>. The rotation
of the shaft thus causes
a continuous circulation of
oil through the footstep.
One experiment from the
report mentioned above
may be quoted. A 3-in.
shaft, revolving 128 times
per minute and supported
on a manganese bronze
bearing lubricated in the
way explained above sustained
increasing loads
until, at a load of 300
pounds per square inch of
the area of the end of the
shaft, it seized. The
mechanical details of a footstep may be varied for purposes of
adjustment in a variety of ways similarly to the variations of a
common bearing already explained.</p>

<p><i>Thrust Block Bearing</i>.&mdash;In cases where a bearing is required to
resist a longitudinal movement of the shaft through it, as for
example in the case of the propeller shaft of a marine engine or a
vertical shaft supporting a heavy load not carried on a footstep,
the shaft is provided with one or more collars which are grooved
with corresponding recesses in the brasses of the bearing. A
general sketch of a thrust block for a propeller shaft is shown in
fig. 7. There are seven collars turned on the shaft and into the
circumferential grooves between them fit corresponding
circumferential projections on the brasses, these projections being
formed in the case illustrated by means of half rings which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page580" id="page580"></a>580</span>
fitted into grooves turned in the brasses. This method of
construction allows an individual ring to be replaced or adjusted
if it should get hot. The total area of the rubbing surfaces should
be proportioned so that the average load is not more than from 50
to 70 &#8468; per sq. in. Arrangements are usually made for cooling a
thrust block with water in case of heating. The spindles of
drilling machines, boring machine spindles, turbine shafts may be
cited as examples of vertical shafts supported on one collar.
Experiments on the friction of a collar bearing have been made
by the Research Committee of the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers (<i>Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.</i>, 1888).</p>

<p><i>Roller and Ball Bearings</i>.&mdash;If rollers are placed between two
surfaces having relative tangential motion the frictional resistance
to be overcome is the small resistance to rolling. The rollers move
along with a velocity equal to one half the relative velocity of the
surfaces. This way of reducing frictional resistance has been
applied to all kinds of mechanical contrivances, including bearings
for shafts, railway axle boxes, and axle boxes for tramcars. An
example of a roller bearing for a line shaft is illustrated in figs. 8
and 9. The main casting, A, and cap, C, bolted together, form a
spherical seating for the part of the bearing E corresponding to
the brasses in a bearing of the usual type. Between the inside of
the casting E and the journal are placed rollers held in position
relatively to one another by a &ldquo;squirrel cage&rdquo; casting, the
section of the bars of which are clearly shown in the half sectional
elevation, fig. 9. This squirrel cage ensures that the several axes
of the rollers keep parallel to the axis of the journal during the
rolling motion. The rollers are made of hard tool steel, and the
surfaces of the journal and bearing between which they roll are
hardened.</p>

<p>Two rings of balls may be used instead of a single ring of
rollers, and the kind of ball bearing thus obtained is in general
use principally in connexion with bicycles and motor cars (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bicycle</a></span>). In ball bearings the load is concentrated at a few
points, the points where the balls touch the race, and in the roller
bearing at a few lines, the lines of contact between the rollers and
the surfaces of the journal and bearing; consequently the load
which bearings of this kind carry must not be great enough to
cause any indentation at the points or lines of contact. Both
rollers and balls, and the paths on which they roll, therefore, are
made of hard material; further, balls and rollers must all be
exactly the same size in an individual bearing in order to distribute
the load between the points or lines of contact as uniformly
as possible. The finest workmanship is required therefore
to make good roller or good ball bearings.</p>

<p><i>Bearings for High Speeds and Forced Lubrication</i>.&mdash;When the
shaft turns the metallic surfaces of the brass and the journal are
prevented from actual contact by a film of oil which is formed and
maintained by the motion of the shaft and which sustains the
pressure between the journal and the brass provided the surfaces
are accurately formed and the supply of oil is unlimited. This
film changes what would otherwise be the friction between
metallic surfaces into a viscous resistance within the film itself.
When through a limited supply of oil or imperfect lubrication
this film is imperfect or fails altogether and allows the journal to
make metallic contact with the brass, the friction increases; and
it may increase so much that the bearing rapidly becomes hot and
may ultimately seize, that is to say the rubbing surfaces may
become stuck together. With the object of reducing the friction
at the points of metallic contact and of confining the damage of a
hot bearing to the easily renewable brass, the latter is partially,
sometimes wholly, lined with a soft fusible metal, technically
known as white metal, which melts away before actual seizure
takes place, and thus saves the journal which is more expensive
because it is generally formed on a large and expensive shaft.
However perfectly the film fulfils its function, the work required
to overcome the viscous resistance of the film during the continuous
rotation of the shaft appears as heat, and in consequence
the temperature of the bearing gradually rises until the rate at
which heat is produced is equal to the rate at which it is radiated
from the bearing. Hence in order that a journal may revolve
with a minimum resistance and without undue heating two
precautions must be taken: (1) means must be taken to ensure
that the film of oil is complete and never fails; and (2) arrangements
must be made for controlling the temperature should it rise
too high. The various lubricating devices already explained
supply sufficient oil to form a partial film, since experiments have
shown that the friction of bearings lubricated in this way is akin
to solid friction, thus indicating at least partial metallic contact.
In order to supply enough oil to form and maintain a film with
certainty the journal should be run in an oil bath, or oil should be
supplied to the bearing under pressure sufficient to force it in
between the surfaces against the load. A bearing to which forced
lubrication and water cooling are applied is illustrated in fig. 10,
which represents one of the bearings of a Westinghouse turbo-alternator
installed at the power station of the Underground
Electric Railways Company of London at Lots Road, Chelsea.
Oil flows under pressure from a tank
on the top of a tower along a supply
pipe to the oil inlet O, and after
passing through the bearing and
performing its duty as a film it falls
away from each end of the journal
into the bottom of the main casting,
from which a pipe, E, conveys the
oil back to the base of the tank tower
where it is cooled and finally pumped
back into the tank. There is thus a
continuous circulation of oil through
the bearing. The space C is for cooling
water; in fact the bearing is water
jacketed and the jacket is connected
to a supply pipe and a drain pipe so
that a continuous circulation may be
maintained if desired. This bearing is 12 in. in diameter and
48 in. long, and it carries a load of about 12.8 tons. The rise in
temperature of the bearing under normal conditions of working
without water circulating in the jacket is approximately 38° F.
The speed of rotation is such that the surface velocity is about
50 ft. per second.</p>

<p>Forced lubrication in connexion with the bearings of high-speed
engines was introduced in 1890 by Messrs Belliss &amp; Morcom,
Ltd., under patents taken out in the name of A.C. Pain. It
should be understood that providing the film of oil in the bearing
of an engine can be properly maintained a double-acting engine
can be driven at a high speed without any knocking, and without
perceptible wear of the rubbing surfaces. Fig. 11 shows that the
general arrangement of the bearings of a Belliss &amp; Morcom
engine arranged for forced lubrication. A small force-pump F,
driven from the eccentric strap X, delivers oil into the pipe P,
along which it passes to A, the centre of the right-hand main
bearing. There is a groove turned on the inside of the brass
from which a slanting hole leads to B. The oil when it arrives
at A thus has two paths open to it, one to the right and left of
the groove through the bearing, the other along the slanting
hole to B. At B it divides again into two streams, one stream
going upwards to the eccentric sheave, and a part continuing
up the pipe Q to the eccentric pin. The second stream from B
follows the slanting hole in the crank shaft to C, where it is led
to the big end journal through the pipe R to the crosshead pin,
and through the slanting hole to D, where it finds its way into the
left main bearing. The oil forced through each bearing falls
away to the right and to the left of the journal and drops into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page581" id="page581"></a>581</span>
the bottom of the engine framing, whence it is again fed to the
pump through a strainer. The parts of an engine lubricated in
this way must be entirely enclosed.</p>

<p><i>Load on bearings.</i>&mdash;The distribution of pressure over the
film of lubricant separating the rubbing surfaces of a
bearing is variable, being greatest at a point near but not
at the crown of the brass, and falling away to zero in all
directions towards the boundaries of the film. It is usual
in practice to ignore this variation of pressure through
the film, and to indicate the severity with which the
bearing is loaded by stating the load per square inch of
the rubbing surfaces projected on to the diametral
plane of the journal. Thus the projected area of the
surfaces of a journal 6 in. in diameter and 8 in. long is
48 sq. in., and if the total load carried by the bearing is 20,000 pounds, the
bearing would be said to carry a load of 417 pounds per square
inch. When a shaft rotates in a bearing continuously in one
direction the load per square inch with which it is safe to load
the bearing in order to avoid undue heating is much less than if
the motion is intermittent. A table of a few values of the bearing
loads used in practice is given in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lubricants</a></span>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Bearing Friction.</i>&mdash;If W is the total load on a bearing, and if µ is
the coefficient of friction between the rubbing surfaces, the tangential
resistance to turning is expressed by the product µW. If v is the
relative velocity of the rubbing surfaces, the work done per second
against friction is µWv foot pounds. This quantity of work is converted
into heat, and the heat produced per second is therefore
µWv/778 British Thermal Units. The coefficient µ is a variable
quantity, and bearing in mind that a properly lubricated journal is
separated from its supporting brass by a film of lubricant it might
be expected that µ would have values characteristic of the coefficient
of friction between two metallic surfaces, merging into the
characteristics properly belonging to fluid friction, according as the
oil film varied from an imperfect to a perfect condition, that is,
according as the lubrication is partial or complete, completeness
being attained by the use of an oil bath or by some method of forced
lubrication. This expectation is entirely borne out by experimental
researches. Beauchamp Tower (&ldquo;Report on Friction Experiments,&rdquo;
<i>Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.</i>, November 1883) found that when oil was
supplied to a bearing by means of a pad the coefficient of friction
was approximately constant with the value of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span>, thus following the
law of solid friction; but when the journal was lubricated by means
of an oil bath the coefficient of friction varied nearly inversely as
the load on the bearing, thus making µW = constant. The tangential
resistance in this case is characteristic of fluid friction since it is
independent of the pressure. Tower&rsquo;s experiments were carried
out at a nearly constant temperature. The later experiments of
O. Lasche (<i>Zeitsch. Verein deutsche Ingenieure</i>, 1902, 46,
pp. 1881 et seq.) show how µ depends upon the temperature. Lasche&rsquo;s main
results with regard to the variation of µ are briefly:&mdash;µW is a constant
quantity, thus confirming Tower&rsquo;s earlier experiments; µ is
practically independent of the relative velocity of the rubbing
surfaces within the limits of 3 to 50 ft. per second; and the
product µt is constant, t being the temperature of the bearing.
Writing p for the load per unit of projected area of the bearing,
Lasche found that the result of the experiments could be expressed
by the simple formula pµt = constant = 2, where p = the pressure in
kilograms per square centimetre, and t = the temperature in degrees
centigrade. If p is changed to pounds per square inch the constant
in the expression is approximately 30. The expression is valid
between limits of pressure 14 to 213 pounds per square inch, limits of
temperature 30° to 100° C., and between limits of velocity 3 to 50 ft.
per second.</p>

<p><i>Theory of Lubrication.</i>&mdash;After the publication of Tower&rsquo;s
experiments on journal friction Professor Osborne Reynolds showed
(<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1886, p. 157) that the facts observed in connexion
with a journal lubricated by means of an oil bath could be explained by
a theory based upon the general principles of the motion of a viscous
fluid. It is first established as an essential part of the theory that
the radius of the brass must be slightly greater than the radius of
the journal as indicated in fig. 12, where J is the centre of the journal
and I the centre of the brass. Given this difference of curvature
and a sufficient supply of oil, the rotation of the journal
produces and maintains an oil film between the rubbing
surfaces, the circumferential extent of which depends upon
the rate of the oil supply and the external load. With an
unlimited supply of oil, that is with oil-bath lubrication, the
film extends continuously to the extremities of the brass,
unless such extension would lead to negative pressures and
therefore to a discontinuity, in which case the film ends
where the pressures in the film become negative. The
minimum distance between the journal and the brass occurs at
the point H (fig. 12), on the off side of the point O where the line
of action of the load cuts the surface of the journal. To the right
and left of H the thickness of the film gradually increases, this being
the condition that the oil-flow to and from the film may be
automatically maintained. With an unlimited supply of oil the point H
moves farther from O as the load increases until it reaches a
maximum distance, and then it moves back again towards O as the
load is further increased until a limiting load is reached at which
the pressure in the film becomes negative at the boundaries of the
film, when the boundaries recede from the edges of the brass as
though the supply of oil were limited.</p>

<p>In the mathematical development of the theory it is first necessary
to define the coefficient of viscosity. This is done as follows:&mdash;If
two parallel surfaces AB, CD are separated by a viscous film, and if
whilst CD is fixed AB moves in a tangential direction with velocity
U, the surface of the film in contact with CD clings to it and remains
at rest, whilst the lower surface of the film clings to and moves with
the surface AB. At intermediate points in the film the tangential
motion of the fluid will vary uniformly from zero to U, and the
tangential resistance will be F = µU/h, where µ is the coefficient of
viscosity and h is the thickness of the film. With this definition of
viscosity and from the general equations representing the stress in
a viscous fluid, the following equation is established, giving the
relations between p, the pressure at any point in the film, h the
thickness of the film at a point x measured round the circumference of
the journal in the direction of relative motion, and U the relative
tangential velocity of the surfaces,</p>

<p class="noind">In this equation all the quantities are independent of the co-ordinate

J. Perry, the value of h is taken to be h = h<span class="su">0</span> + ax², where h<span class="su">0</span>
is the minimum thickness of the film, the equation reduces to the form</p>

<p class="noind">and this can be integrated. The process of reduction from the form

<p>Professor Reynolds, applying the results of his investigation to
one of Tower&rsquo;s experiments, plotted the pressures through the film
both circumferentially and longitudinally, and the agreement with
the observed pressure of the experiment was exceedingly close. The
whole investigation of Professor Reynolds is a remarkable one, and
is in fact the first real explanation of the fact that oil is able to insinuate
itself between the journal and the brass of a bearing carrying
a heavy load. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lubrication</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">BÉARN,<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> formerly a small frontier province in the south of
France, now included within the department of Basses-Pyrénées.
It was bounded on the W. by Soule and Lower Navarre, on the
N. by Chalosse, Tursan and Astarac, E. by Bigorre and S. by the
Pyrénées. Its name can be traced back to the town of Beneharnum
(Lescar). The <i>civitas Beneharnensium</i> was included in
the <i>Novempopulania</i>. It was conquered by the Vascones in the
6th century, and in 819 became a viscounty dependent on the
dukes of Aquitaine&mdash;a feudal link which was broken in the
11th century, when the viscounts ceased to acknowledge any
suzerain. They then reigned over the two dioceses of Lescar
and Oloron; but their capital was Morlaas, where they had a
mint which was famous throughout the middle ages. In the
13th century Gaston VII., of the Catalonian house of Moncade,
made Orthez his seat of government. His long reign (1229-1290)
was a perpetual struggle with the kings of France and England,
each anxious to assert his suzerainty over Béarn. As Gaston
left only daughters, the viscounty passed at his death to the
family of Foix, from whom it was transmitted through the
houses of Grailly and Albret to the Bourbons, and they, in the
person of Henry IV., king of Navarre, made it an apanage of
the crown of France. It was not formally incorporated in the
royal domains, however, until 1620. None of these political
changes weakened the independent spirit of the Béarnais. From
the 11th century onward, they were governed by their own
special customs or <i>fors</i>. These were drawn up in the language
of the country, a Romance dialect (1288 being the date of the
most ancient written code), and are remarkable for the manner
in which they define the rights of the sovereign, determining
the reciprocal obligations of the viscount and his subjects or
vassals. Moreover, from the 12th century Béarn enjoyed a kind
of representative government, with <i>cours plénières</i> composed of
deputies from the three estates. From 1220 onward, the
judiciary powers of these assemblies were exercised by a <i>cour
majour</i> of twelve barons <i>jurats</i> charged with the duty of maintaining
the integrity of the <i>fors</i>. When Gaston-Phoebus
wished to establish a regular annual hearth-tax (<i>fouage</i>) in the
viscounty, he convoked the deputies of the three estates in
assemblies called <i>états</i>. These soon acquired extensive political
and financial powers, which continued in operation till 1789.
Although, when Béarn was annexed to the domains of the crown,
it was granted a <i>conseil d&rsquo;état</i> and a parlement, which sat at Pau,
the province also retained its <i>fors</i> until the Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEATON<a name="ar182" id="ar182"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Bethune</span>), <b>DAVID,</b> (<i>c.</i> 1494-1546), Scottish
cardinal and archbishop of St Andrews, was a younger son of
John Beaton of Balfour in the county of Fife, and is said to have
been born in the year 1494. He was educated at the universities
of St Andrews and Glasgow, and in his sixteenth year was sent to
Paris, where he studied civil and canon law. About this time he
was presented to the rectory of Campsie by his uncle James
Beaton, then archbishop of Glasgow. When James Beaton was
translated to St Andrews in 1522 he resigned the rich abbacy of
Arbroath in his nephew&rsquo;s favour, under reservation of one half of
the revenues to himself during his lifetime. The great ability of
Beaton and the patronage of his uncle ensured his rapid promotion
to high offices in the church and kingdom. He was sent by
King James V. on various missions to France, and in 1528 was
appointed keeper of the privy seal. He took a leading part in the
negotiations connected with the king&rsquo;s marriages, first with
Madeleine of France, and afterwards with Mary of Guise. At the
French court he was held in high estimation by King Francis I.,
and was consecrated bishop of Mirepoix in Languedoc in
December 1537. On the 20th of December 1538 he was appointed
a cardinal priest by Pope Paul III., under the title of St Stephen
in the Coelian Hill. He was the only Scotsman who had been
named to that high office by an undisputed right, Cardinal
Wardlaw, bishop of Glasgow, having received his appointment
from the anti-pope Clement VII. On the death of Archbishop
James Beaton in 1539, the cardinal was raised to the primatial
see of Scotland.</p>

<p>Beaton was one of King James&rsquo;s most trusted advisers, and it
was mainly due to his influence that the king drew closer the
French alliance and refused Henry VIII.&rsquo;s overtures to follow
him in his religious policy. On the death of James in December
1542 he attempted to assume office as one of the regents for the
infant sovereign Mary, founding his pretensions on an alleged will
of the late king; but his claims were disregarded, and the earl of
Arran, head of the great house of Hamilton, and next heir to the
throne, was declared regent by the estates. The cardinal was, by
order of the regent, committed to the custody of Lord Seaton;
but his imprisonment was merely nominal, and he was soon again
at liberty and at the head of the party opposed to the English
alliance. Arran too was soon won over to his views, dismissed
the preachers by whom he had been surrounded, and joined the
cardinal at Stirling, where in September 1543 Beaton crowned
the young queen. In the same year he was raised to the office of
chancellor of Scotland, and was appointed protonotary apostolic
and legate <i>a latere</i> by the pope. Had Beaton confined himself to
secular politics, his strenuous opposition to the plans of Henry
VIII. for the subjugation of Scotland would have earned him the
lasting gratitude of his countrymen. Unfortunately politics were
inextricably interwoven with the religious controversies of the
time, and resistance to English influence involved resistance to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page583" id="page583"></a>583</span>
the activities of the reformers in the church, whose ultimate
victory has obscured the cardinal&rsquo;s genuine merits as a statesman.
During the lifetime of his uncle, Beaton had shared in the efforts
of the hierarchy to suppress the reformed doctrines, and pursued
the same line of conduct still more systematically after his
elevation to the primacy. The popular accounts of the persecution
for which he was responsible are no doubt exaggerated, and
it sometimes ceased for considerable periods so far as capital
punishments were concerned. When the sufferers were of humble
rank not much notice was taken of them. It was otherwise when
a more distinguished victim was selected in the person of George
Wishart. Wishart had returned to Scotland, after an absence of
several years, about the end of 1544. His sermons produced a
great effect, and he was protected by several barons of the
English faction. These barons, with the knowledge and approbation
of King Henry, were engaged in a plot to assassinate the
cardinal, and in this plot Wishart is now proved to have been a
willing agent. The cardinal, though ignorant of the details of the
plot, perhaps suspected Wishart&rsquo;s knowledge of it, and in any
case was not sorry to have an excuse for seizing one of the most
eloquent supporters of the new opinions. For some time he was
unsuccessful; but at last, with the aid of the regent, he arrested
the preacher, and carried him to his castle of St Andrews. On the
28th of February 1546 Wishart was brought to trial in the
cathedral before the cardinal and other judges, the regent
declining to take any active part, and, being found guilty of
heresy, was condemned to death and burnt.</p>

<p>The death of Wishart produced a deep effect on the Scottish
people, and the cardinal became an object of general dislike,
which encouraged his enemies to proceed with the design they
had formed against him. Naturally resolute and fearless, he
seems to have under-estimated his danger, the more so since his
power had never seemed more secure. He crossed over to Angus,
and took part in the wedding of his illegitimate daughter with the
heir of the earl of Crawford. On his return to St Andrews he
took up his residence in the castle. The conspirators, the chief
of whom were Norman Leslie, master of Rothes, and William
Kirkaldy of Grange, contrived to obtain admission at daybreak
of the 29th of May 1546, and murdered the cardinal under
circumstances of horrible mockery and atrocity.</p>

<p>The character of Beaton has already been indicated. As a
statesman he was able, resolute, and in his general policy patriotic.
As an ecclesiastic he maintained the privileges of the hierarchy
and the dominant system of belief conscientiously, but always
with harshness and sometimes with cruelty. His immoralities,
like his acts of persecution, were exaggerated by his opponents;
but his private life was undoubtedly a scandal to religion, and has
only the excuse that it was not worse than that of most of his
order at the time. The authorship of the writings ascribed to him
in several biographical notices rests on no better authority than
the apocryphal statements of Thomas Dempster.</p>

<p>Beaton&rsquo;s uncle, James Beaton, or Bethune (d. 1539), archbishop
of Glasgow and St Andrews, was lord treasurer of Scotland
before he became archbishop of Glasgow in 1509, was chancellor
from 1513 to 1526, and was appointed archbishop of St Andrews
and primate of Scotland in 1522. He was one of the regents
during the minority of James V., and was chiefly responsible for
this king&rsquo;s action in allying himself with France and not with
England. He burned Patrick Hamilton and other heretics, and
died at St Andrews in September 1539.</p>

<p>This prelate must not be confused with another, James Beaton,
or Bethune (1517-1603), the last Roman Catholic archbishop of
Glasgow. A son of John Bethune of Auchmuty and a nephew of
Cardinal Beaton, James was a trusted adviser of the Scottish
regent, Mary of Lorraine, widow of James V., and a determined
foe of the reformers. In 1552 he was consecrated archbishop of
Glasgow, but from 1560 until his death in 1603 he lived in Paris,
acting as ambassador for Scotland at the French court.</p>

(852 foreign-born); (1910) 9356. It is served by the Chicago,

the Union Pacific railways. Beatrice is the seat of the state

The city is very prettily situated in the valley of the Big Blue

manufactures are dairy products (there is a large creamery),
canned goods, flour and grist mill products, gasoline engines,
well-machinery, barbed wire, tiles, ploughs, windmills, corn-huskers,
and hay-balers. Beatrice was founded in 1857, becoming
the county-seat in the same year. It was reached by its first
railway and was incorporated as a town in 1871, was chartered as
a city in 1873, and in 1901 became a city of the first class.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEATTIE, JAMES<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> (1735-1803), Scottish poet and writer on
philosophy, was born at Laurencekirk, Kincardine, Scotland,
on the 25th of October 1735. His father, a small farmer and
shopkeeper, died when he was very young; but an elder brother
sent him to Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he gained a
bursary. In 1753 he was appointed schoolmaster of Fordoun
in his native county. Here he had as neighbours the eccentric
Francis Garden (afterwards Lord Gardenstone, judge of the
supreme court of Scotland), and Lord Monboddo. In 1758 he
became an usher in the grammar school of Aberdeen, and two
years later he was made professor of moral philosophy at
Marischal College. Here he became closely acquainted with
Dr Thomas Reid, Dr George Campbell, Dr Alexander Gérard
and others, who formed a kind of literary or philosophic society
known as the &ldquo;Wise Club.&rdquo; They met once a fortnight to
discuss speculative questions, David Hume&rsquo;s philosophy being
an especial object of criticism. In 1761 Beattie published a
small volume of <i>Original Poems and Translations</i>, which contained
little work of any value. Its author in later days destroyed
all the copies he found. In 1770 Beattie published his <i>Essay
on the Nature and Immutability of Truth in opposition to sophistry
and scepticism</i>, the object of which, as explained by its author,
was to &ldquo;prove the universality and immutability of moral
sentiment&rdquo; (letter to Sir W. Forbes, 17th January 1765). It
was in fact a direct attack on Hume, and part of its great popularity
was due to the fact. Hume is said to have justly complained
that Beattie &ldquo;had not used him like a gentleman,&rdquo; but
made no answer to the book, which has no philosophical value.
Beattie&rsquo;s portrait, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, hangs at Marischal
College, Aberdeen. The philosopher is painted with the <i>Essay
on Truth</i> in his hand, while a figure of Truth thrusts down
three figures representing, according to Sir W. Forbes, sophistry,
scepticism and infidelity. Reynolds in a letter to Beattie
(February 1774) intimates that he is well enough pleased that
one of the figures is identified with Hume, and that he intended
Voltaire to be one of the group. Beattie visited London in 1773,
and was received with the greatest honour by George III., who
conferred on him a pension of £200 a year. In 1771 and 1774
he published the first and second parts of <i>The Minstrel</i>, a poem
which met with great and immediate success. The Spenserian
stanza in which it is written is managed with smoothness and
skill, and there are many fine descriptions of natural scenery.
It is entirely on his poetry that Beattie&rsquo;s reputation rests. The
best known of his minor poems are &ldquo;The Hermit&rdquo; and &ldquo;Retirement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1773 he was offered the chair of moral philosophy at Edinburgh
University, but did not accept it. Beattie made many
friends, and lost none. &ldquo;We all love Beattie,&rdquo; said Dr Johnson.
&ldquo;Mrs Thrale says, if ever she has another husband she will have
him.&rdquo; He was in high favour too with Mrs Montagu and the
other <i>bas bleus</i>. Beattie was unfortunate in his domestic life.
Mary Dunn, whom he married in 1767, became insane, and his
two sons died just as they were attaining manhood. The elder,
James Hay Beattie, a young man of great promise, who at the
age of nineteen had been associated with his father in his
professorship, died in 1790. In 1794 the father published <i>Essays
and Fragments in Prose and Verse by James Hay Beattie</i> with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page584" id="page584"></a>584</span>
touching memoir. The younger brother died in 1796. Beattie
never recovered from this second bereavement. His mind was
seriously affected, and, although he continued to lecture occasionally,
he neither wrote nor studied. In April 1799 he had a
stroke of paralysis, and died on the 18th of August 1803.</p>

<p>Beattie&rsquo;s other poetical works include <i>The Judgment of Paris</i>
(1765), and &ldquo;Verses on the death of [Charles] Churchill,&rdquo; a
bitter attack which the poet afterwards suppressed. The best
edition is the <i>Poetical Works</i> (1831, new ed. 1866) in the
<i>Aldine Edition of the British Poets</i>, with an admirable memoir by
Alexander Dyce.</p>

theologian and geographer, was born about 730, and died in 798.
About 776 he published his <i>Commentaria in Apocalypsin</i>, containing
one of the oldest Christian world-maps. He took a
prominent part in the Adoptionist controversy, and wrote
against the views of Felix of Urgel, especially as upheld by
Elipandus of Toledo. As confessor to Queen Adosinda, wife of
King Silo of Oviedo (774-783), and as the master of Alcuin and
Etherius of Osma, Beatus exercised wide influence. His original
map, which was probably intended to illustrate, above all, the
distribution of the Apostolic missions throughout the world&mdash;depicting
the head of Peter at Rome, of Andrew in Achaia, of
Thomas in India, of James in Spain, and so forth&mdash;has survived
in ten more or less modified copies. One only of these&mdash;the
&ldquo;Osma&rdquo; of 1203&mdash;preserves the Apostolic pictures; among
the remaining examples, that of &ldquo;St Sever,&rdquo; now at Paris, and
dating from about 1030, is the most valuable; that of &ldquo;Valcavado,&rdquo;
recently in the Ashburnham Library, executed in 970,
is the earliest; that of &ldquo;Turin,&rdquo; dating from about 1100, is
perhaps the most curious. Three others&mdash;&ldquo;Valladolid&rdquo; of
about 1035, &ldquo;Madrid&rdquo; of 1047, and &ldquo;London&rdquo; of 1109&mdash;are
derivatives of the &ldquo;Valcavado-Ashburnham&rdquo; of 970; the
eighth, &ldquo;Paris II,&rdquo; is connected, though not very intimately,
with &ldquo;St Sever,&rdquo; otherwise &ldquo;Paris I&rdquo;; the ninth and tenth,
&ldquo;Gerona&rdquo; and &ldquo;Paris III,&rdquo; belong to the Turin group of
Beatus maps. All these works are emphatically of &ldquo;dark-age&rdquo;
character; very seldom do they suggest the true forms of
countries, seas, rivers or mountains, but they embody some useful
information as to early medieval conditions and history. St
Isidore appears to be their principal authority; they also draw,
directly or indirectly, from Orosius, St Jerome, St Augustine,
and probably from a lost map of classical antiquity, represented
in a measure by the Peutinger Table of the 13th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUCAIRE,<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> a town of south-eastern France, in the department
of Gard, 17 m. E. by S. of Nîmes on the Paris-Lyon railway.
Pop. (1906) 7284. Beaucaire is situated on the right bank of the
Rhone, opposite Tarascon, with which it is connected by two
handsome bridges, a suspension-bridge of four spans and 1476 ft.
in length, and a railway bridge. A triangular keep, a chapel,
and other remains of a château (13th and 14th centuries) of the
counts of Toulouse stand on the rocky pine-clad hill which rises
to the north of the town; the chapel, dedicated to St Louis,
belongs to the latest period of Romanesque architecture, and
contains fine sculptures. The town derives celebrity from the
great July fair, which has been held here annually since the 12th
century, but has now lost its former importance (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fair</a></span>).
Beaucaire gives its name to the canal which communicates with
the sea (near Aigues-Mortes) and connects it with the Canal du
Midi, forming part of the line of communication between the
Rhone and the Garonne. The town is an important port on the
Rhone, and its commerce, the chief articles of which are wine, and
freestone from quarries in the vicinity, is largely water-borne.
Among its industries are distilling and the manufacture of
furniture, and the preparation of vermicelli, sausages and other
provisions.</p>

<p>Beaucaire occupies the site of the ancient <i>Ugernum</i>, and
several remains of the Roman city have been discovered, as well
as (in 1734) the road that led from Nîmes. The present name
is derived from <i>Bellum Quadrum</i>, a descriptive appellation
applied in the middle ages either to the château or to the rock
on which it stands. In 1125 Beaucaire came into the possession
of the counts of Toulouse, one of whom, Raymund VI., established
the importance of its fairs by the grant of privileges. In
the Wars of the League it suffered severely, and in 1632 its
castle was destroyed by Richelieu.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEAUCE<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span> (Lat. <i>Belsia</i>), a physical region of north-central
France, comprising large portions of the departments of Eure-et-Loir
and Loir-et-Cher, and also extending into those of Loiret
and Seine-et-Oise. It has an area of over 2800 sq. m., its limits
being roughly defined by the course of the Essonne on the E.,
of the Loire on the S., and of the Brenne, the Loir and the Eure
towards the W., though in the latter direction it extends somewhat
beyond these boundaries. The Beauce is a treeless, arid
and monotonous plain of limestone formation; windmills and
church spires are the only prominent features of the landscape.
Apart from the rivers on its borders, it is watered by insignificant
streams, of which the Conie in the west need alone be
mentioned. The inhabitants live in large villages, and are
occupied in agriculture, particularly in the cultivation of wheat,
for which the Beauce is celebrated. Clover and lucerne are
the other leading crops, and large flocks of sheep are kept in the
region. Chartres is its chief commercial centre.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEAUCHAMP,<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> the name of several important English families.
The baronial house of Beauchamp of Bedford was founded at
the Conquest by Hugh de Beauchamp, who received a barony
in Bedfordshire. His eldest son Simon left a daughter, whose
husband Hugh (brother of the count of Meulan) was created
earl of Bedford by Stephen. But the heir-male, Miles de Beauchamp,
nephew of Simon, held Bedford Castle against the king
in 1137-1138. From his brother Payn descended the barons of
Bedford, of whom William held Bedford Castle against the royal
forces in the struggle for the Great Charter, and was afterwards
made prisoner at the battle of Lincoln, while John, who sided
with the barons under Simon de Montfort, fell at Evesham.
With him the line ended, but a younger branch was seated at
Eaton Socon, Beds., where the earthworks of their castle remain,
and held their barony there into the 14th century.</p>

<p>The Beauchamps of Elmley, Worcestershire, the greatest
house of the name, were founded by the marriage of Walter de
Beauchamp with the daughter of Urise d&rsquo;Abetot, a Domesday
baron, which brought him the shrievalty of Worcestershire, the
office of a royal steward, and large estates. His descendant
William, of Elmley, married Isabel, sister and eventually heiress
to William Mauduit, earl of Warwick, and their son succeeded
in 1268 to Warwick Castle and that earldom, which remained
with his descendants in the male line till 1445. The earls of the
Beauchamp line played a great part in English history. Guy,
the 2nd, distinguished himself in the Scottish campaigns of
Edward I., who warned him at his death against Piers Gaveston.
Under Edward II. he was one of the foremost foes of Piers, who
had styled him &ldquo;the black cur of Arden,&rdquo; and with whose death
he was closely connected. As one of the &ldquo;lords ordainers&rdquo; he
was a recognized leader of the opposition to Edward II. By
the heiress of the Tonis he left at his death in 1315 a son Earl
Thomas, who distinguished himself at Crécy and Poitiers, was
marshal of the English host, and, with his brother John, one of
the founders of the order of the Garter. In 1369 his son Earl
Thomas succeeded; from 1376 to 1379 he was among the lords
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page585" id="page585"></a>585</span>
striving for reform, and in the latter year he was appointed
governor to the king. Under Richard II. he joined the lords
appellant in their opposition to the king and his ministers, and
was in power with them 1388-1389; treacherously arrested by
Richard in 1397, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London (the
Beauchamp Tower being called after him), but liberated by
Henry IV. on his triumph (1399). In 1401 he was succeeded
by his son Earl Richard, a brave and chivalrous warrior, who
defeated Owen Glendower, fought the Percys at Shrewsbury,
and, after travelling in state through Europe and the Holy Land,
was employed against the Lollards and afterwards as lay
ambassador from England to the council of Constance (1414).
He held command for a time at Calais, and took an active part
in the French campaigns of Henry V., who created him earl
and count of Aumale in Normandy. He had charge of the
education of Henry VI., and in 1437 was appointed lieutenant
of France and of Normandy. Dying at Rouen in 1439, he left
by Isabel, widow of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Worcester, a
son, Earl Henry, who was created duke of Warwick, 1445, and
is alleged, but without authority, to have been crowned king of
the Isle of Wight by Henry VI. He died, the last of his line, in
June 1445. On the death of Anne, his only child, in 1449, his
vast inheritance passed to Anne, his sister of the whole blood,
wife of Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury (&ldquo;the Kingmaker&rdquo;),
who thereupon became earl of Warwick.</p>

<p>Of the cadet branches of the house, the oldest was that of
Powyke and Alcester, which obtained a barony in 1447 and
became extinct in 1496; from it sprang the Beauchamps, Lords
St. Amand from 1448, of whom was Richard, bishop of Salisbury,
first chancellor of the order of the Garter, and who became
extinct in 1508, being the last known male heirs of the race.
Another cadet was Sir John Beauchamp of Holt, minister of
Richard II., who was created Lord Beauchamp of Kidderminster
(the first baron created by patent) 1387, but beheaded 1388;
the barony became extinct with his son in 1400. Roger, Lord
Beauchamp of Bletsoe, summoned in 1363, is said to have been
descended from the Powyke branch; his line ended early in the
15th century. Later cadets were John, brother of the 3rd earl,
who carried the standard at Crécy, became captain of Calais,
and was summoned as a peer in 1350, but died unmarried; and
William, brother of the 4th earl, who was distinguished in the
French wars, and succeeding to the lands of the Lords Abergavenny
was summoned in that barony 1392; his son was created
earl of Worcester in 1420, but died without male issue in 1422;
from his daughter, who married Sir Edward Neville, descended
the Lords Abergavenny.</p>

<p>The Lords Beauchamp of &ldquo;Hache&rdquo; (1299-1361) were so
named from their seat of Hatch Beauchamp, Somerset, and
were of a wholly distinct family. Their title, &ldquo;Beauchamp of
Hache,&rdquo; was revived for the Seymours in 1536 and 1559. The
title of &ldquo;Beauchamp of Powyke&rdquo; was revived as a barony in
1806 for Richard Lygon (descended through females from the Beauchamps
of Powyke), who was created Earl Beauchamp in 1815.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUCHAMP, ALPHONSE DE,<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> French historian and man of
letters, was born at Monaco in 1767, and died in 1832. In 1784
he entered a Sardinian regiment of marines, but on the outbreak
of war with the French Republic, he refused to fight in what he
considered an unjust cause, and was imprisoned for several
months. After being liberated he took up his residence in Paris,
where he obtained a post in one of the government offices. On
the fall of Robespierre, Beauchamp was transferred to the <i>bureau</i>
of the minister of police, and charged with the superintendence of
the press. This situation opened up to him materials of which he
made use in his first and most popular historical work, <i>Histoire
de la Vendée et des Chouans</i>, 3 vols., 1806. The book, received with
great favour by the people, was displeasing to the authorities.
The third edition was confiscated; its writer was deprived of his
post, and in 1809 was compelled to leave Paris and take up his
abode in Reims. In 1811 he obtained permission to return, and
again received a government appointment. This he had to resign
on the Restoration, but was rewarded with a small pension,
which was continued to his widow after his death.</p>

<p>Beauchamp wrote extensively for the public journals and for
the magazines. His biographical and historical works are
numerous, and those dealing with contemporary events are
valuable, owing to the sources at his disposal. They must,
however, be used with great caution. The following are worth
mention:&mdash;<i>Vie politique, militaire et privée du général Moreau</i>
(1814); <i>Catastrophe de Murat, ou Récit de la dernière révolution de
Naples</i> (1815); <i>Histoire de la guerre d&rsquo;Espagne et du Portugal,
1807-1813</i> (2 vols., 1810); <i>Collection de mémoires relatifs aux
révolutions d&rsquo;Espagne</i> (2 vols., 1824); <i>Histoire de la révolution de
Piémont</i> (2 vols., 1821, 1823); <i>Mémoires secrets et inédits pour
servir à l&rsquo;histoire contemporaine</i> (2 vols., 1825). The <i>Mémoires de
Fouché</i> have also been ascribed to him, but it seems certain that
he only revised and completed a work really composed by Fouché
himself.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUFORT,<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span> the name of the family descended from the union
of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, with Catherine, wife of Sir
Hugh Swynford, taken from a castle in Anjou which belonged to
John of Gaunt. There were four children of this union&mdash;John,
created earl of Somerset and marquess of Dorset; Henry, afterwards
bishop of Winchester and cardinal (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Beaufort,
Henry</a></span>); Thomas, made duke of Exeter and chancellor; and
Joan, who married Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland, and
died in 1440. In 1396, some years after the birth of these
children, John of Gaunt and Catherine were married, and in 1397
the Beauforts were declared legitimate by King Richard II. In
1407 this action was confirmed by their half-brother, King
Henry IV., but on this occasion they were expressly excluded
from the succession to the English throne.</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Beaufort</span>, earl of Somerset (<i>c.</i> 1373-1410), assisted
Richard II. in 1397 when the king attacked the lords appellants,
and made himself an absolute ruler. For these services he was
made marquess of Dorset, but after the deposition of Richard in
1399, he was degraded to his former rank as earl. In 1401,
however, he was declared loyal, and appeared later in command
of the English fleet. He married Margaret, daughter of Thomas
Holland, second earl of Kent, and died in March 1410, leaving
three sons, Henry, John, and Edmund, and two daughters, Jane
or Joan, who married James I., king of Scotland, and Margaret,
who married Thomas Courtenay, earl of Devon.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Thomas Beaufort</span> (d. 1426) held various high offices under
Henry IV., and took a leading part in suppressing the rising in the
north in 1405. He became chancellor in 1410, but resigned this
office in January 1412 and took part in the expedition to France
in the same year. He was then created earl of Dorset, and when
Henry V. became king in 1413, he was made lieutenant of
Aquitaine and took charge of Harfleur when this town passed into
the possession of the English. In 1416 he became lieutenant of
Normandy, and was created duke of Exeter; and returning to
England he compelled the Scots to raise the siege of Roxburgh.
Crossing to France in 1418 with reinforcements for Henry V., he
took an active part in the subsequent campaign, was made
captain of Rouen, and went to the court of France to treat for
peace. He was then captured by the French at Baugé, but was
soon released and returned to England when he heard of the death
of Henry V. in August 1422. He was one of Henry&rsquo;s executors,
and it is probable that the king entrusted his young son, King
Henry VI., to his care. However this may be, Exeter did not
take a very prominent part in the government, although he was
a member of the council of regency. Having again shared in the
French war, the duke died at Greenwich about the end of the
year 1426. He was buried at Bury St. Edmunds, where his
remains were found in good condition 350 years later. He
married Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Neville of Nornby, but
left no issue. The Beaufort family was continued by <span class="sc">Henry
Beaufort</span> (1401-1419), the eldest son of John Beaufort, earl of

<span class="sc">John Beaufort</span> (1403-1444). The latter fought under Henry V.
in the French wars, and having been taken prisoner remained in
France as a captive until 1437. Soon after his release he returned
to the war, and after the death of Richard Beauchamp, earl of
Warwick, in 1439, acted as commander of the English forces, and,
with his brother Edmund, was successful in recapturing Harfleur.
Although chagrined when Richard, duke of York, was made
regent of France, Beaufort led an expedition to France in 1442,
and in 1443 was made duke of Somerset. He died, probably by
his own hand, in May 1444. He married Margaret, daughter of
Sir John Beauchamp, and left a daughter, <span class="sc">Margaret Beaufort</span>,
afterwards countess of Richmond and Derby, who married, for
her first husband, Edmund Tudor, earl of Richmond, by whom
she became the mother of King Henry VII. In this way the
blood of the Beauforts was mingled with that of the Tudors, and
of all the subsequent occupants of the English throne.</p>

<p>The title of earl of Somerset descended on the death of John
Beaufort in 1444 to his brother <span class="sc">Edmund Beaufort</span>, duke of
Somerset (<i>q.v.</i>), who was killed at St Albans in 1455. By his
marriage with Eleanor Beauchamp, daughter of the fifth earl of
Warwick, he left three sons, Henry, Edmund and John, and a
daughter, Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Henry Beaufort</span> (1436-1464) became duke of Somerset in
1455, and soon began to take part in the struggle against Richard,
duke of York, but failed to dislodge Richard&rsquo;s ally, Richard
Neville, earl of Warwick, from Calais. He took part in the
victory of the Lancastrians at Wakefield in 1460, escaped from
the carnage at Towton in 1461, and shared the attainder of
Henry VI. in the same year. In May 1464 he was captured at
Hexham and was beheaded immediately after the battle. The
title of duke of Somerset was assumed by his brother, <span class="sc">Edmund
Beaufort</span> (<i>c</i>. 1438-1471), who fled from the country after the
disasters to the Lancastrian arms, but returned to England in
1471, in which year he fought at Tewkesbury, and in spite of a
promise of pardon was beheaded after the battle on the 6th of
May 1471. His younger brother <span class="sc">John Beaufort</span> had been killed
probably at this battle, and so on the execution of Edmund the
family became extinct.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Margaret Beaufort</span> married Humphrey, earl of Stafford, and
was the mother of Henry Stafford, duke of Buckingham. Henry
Beaufort, third duke of Somerset (d. 1464), left an illegitimate
son, Charles Somerset, who was created earl of Worcester by
Henry VIII. in 1514. His direct descendant, Henry Somerset,
fifth earl of Worcester, was a loyal partisan of Charles I. and in
1642 was created marquess of Worcester. His grandson, Henry,
the third marquess, was made duke of Beaufort in 1682, and the
present duke of Beaufort is his direct descendant.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUFORT, FRANÇOIS DE VENDÔME,<a name="ar191" id="ar191"></a></span> <span class="sc">Duc de</span> (1616-1669),
a picturesque figure in French history of the 17th century,
was the second son of César de Vendôme, and grandson of Henry
IV., by Gabrielle d&rsquo;Estrées. He began his career in the army and
served in the first campaigns of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, but his
ambitions and unscrupulous character soon found a more
congenial field in the intrigues of the court. In 1642 he joined in
the conspiracy of Cinq Mars against Richelieu, and upon its
failure was obliged to live in exile in England until Richelieu&rsquo;s
death. Returning to France, he became the centre of a group,
known as the &ldquo;Importants,&rdquo; in which court ladies predominated,
especially the duchess of Chevreuse and the duchess of Montbazon.
For an instant after the king&rsquo;s death, this group seemed likely to
prevail, and Beaufort to be the head of the new government.
But Mazarin gained the office, and Beaufort, accused of a plot to
murder Mazarin, was imprisoned in Vincennes, in September
1643. He escaped on the 31st of May 1648, just in time to join
the Fronde, which began in August 1648. He was then with the
parlement and the princes, against Mazarin. His personal
appearance, his affectation of popular manners, his quality of
grandson (legitimized), of Henry IV., rendered him a favourite
of the Parisians, who acclaimed him everywhere. He was known
as the <i>Roi des Halles</i> (&ldquo;king of the markets&rdquo;), and popular
subscriptions were opened to pay his debts. He had hopes of
becoming prime minister. But among the members of the
parlement and the other leaders of the Fronde, he was regarded
as merely a tool. His intelligence was but mediocre, and he
showed no talent during the war. Mazarin, on his return to
Paris, exiled him in October 1652; and he was only allowed to
return in 1654, when the cardinal had no longer any reason to
fear him. Henceforth Beaufort no longer intrigued. In 1658 he
was named general superintendent of navigation, or chief of the
naval army, and faithfully served the king in naval wars from
that on. In 1664 he directed the expedition against the pirates of
Algiers. In 1669 he led the French troops defending Candia
against the Turks, and was killed in a night sortie, on the I5th of
June 1669. His body was brought back to France with great
pomp, and official honours rendered it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUFORT, HENRY<a name="ar192" id="ar192"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1377-1447), English cardinal and
bishop of Winchester, was the second son of John of Gaunt, duke
of Lancaster, by Catherine, wife of Sir Hugh Swynford. His
parents were not married until 1396, and in 1397 King Richard II.
declared the four children of this union to be legitimate. Henry
spent some of his youth at Aix la-Chapelle, and having entered
the church received various appointments, and was consecrated
bishop of Lincoln in July 1398. When his half-brother became
king as Henry IV. in 1399, Beaufort began to take a prominent
place in public life; he was made chancellor in 1403, but he
resigned this office in 1404, when he was translated from Lincoln
to Winchester as the successor of William of Wykeham. He
exercised considerable influence over the prince of Wales, afterwards
King Henry V., and although he steadily supported the
house of Lancaster he opposed the party led by Thomas Arundel,
archbishop of Canterbury. A dispute over money left by John
Beaufort, marquess of Dorset, caused or widened a breach in the
royal family which reached a climax in 1411. The details are not
quite clear, but it seems tolerably certain that the prince and the
bishop, anxious to retain their power, sought to induce Henry IV.
to abdicate in favour of his son. Angry at this request, the king
dismissed his son from the council, and Beaufort appears to have
shared his disgrace. When Henry V. ascended the throne in 1413
the bishop again became chancellor and took a leading part in the
government until 1417, when he resigned his office, and proceeded
to the council which was then sitting at Constance. His arrival
had an important effect on the deliberations of this council, and
the compromise which was subsequently made between the rival
parties was largely his work. Grateful for Beaufort&rsquo;s services,
the new pope Martin V. offered him a cardinal&rsquo;s hat which Henry
V. refused to allow him to accept. Returning to England, he
remained loyal to Henry; and after the king&rsquo;s death in 1422 became
a member of the council and was the chief opponent of the
wild and selfish schemes of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester. In
1424 he became chancellor for the third time, and was mainly
responsible for the conduct of affairs during Gloucester&rsquo;s expedition
to Hainaut. He was disliked by the citizens of London;
and this ill-feeling was heightened when Gloucester, who was a
favourite of the Londoners, returned to England and was doubtless
reproached by Beaufort for the folly of his undertaking. A riot
took place in London, and at the bishop&rsquo;s entreaty, the protector,
John, duke of Bedford, came back to England. As this dispute
was still unsettled when the parliament met at Leicester in
February 1426, Bedford and the lords undertook to arbitrate.
Charged by Gloucester with treason against Henry IV. and his
successors, Beaufort denied the accusations. But although a
reconciliation was effected, the bishop evidently regarded this as
a defeat; and having resigned the chancellorship his energies
were diverted into another channel.</p>

<p>Anxious to secure his aid for the crusade against the Hussites,
Pope Martin again offered him a cardinal&rsquo;s hat, which Beaufort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page587" id="page587"></a>587</span>
accepted. He went to France in 1427, and was then appointed
papal legate for Germany, Hungary and Bohemia; and proceeding
eastwards, he made a bold but futile effort to rally the
crusaders at Tachau. Returning to England to raise money for a
fresh crusade, he was received with great state in London; but
his acceptance of the cardinalate had weakened his position and
Gloucester refused to recognize his legatine commission. Beaufort
gave way on this question, but an unsuccessful attempt was
made in 1429 to deprive him of his see. Having raised some
troops he set out for Bohemia; but owing to the disasters which
had just attended the English arms in France, he was induced to
allow these soldiers to serve in the French war; and in February
1431 the death of Martin V. ended his commission as legate.
Meanwhile an attempt on the part of Gloucester to exclude the
cardinal from the council had failed, and it was decided that his
attendance was required except during the discussion of questions
between the king and the papacy. He accompanied King
Henry VI. to Normandy in April 1430, and in December 1431
crowned him king of France. About this time Gloucester made
another attempt to deprive Beaufort of his see, and it was argued
in the council that as a cardinal he could not hold an English
bishopric. The general council was not inclined to press the case
against him; but the privy council, more clerical and more
hostile, sealed writs of praemunire and attachment against him,
and some of his jewels were seized. On his return to England he
attended the parliament in May 1432, and asked to hear the
charges against him. The king declared him loyal, and a statute
was passed freeing him from any penalties which he might have
incurred under the Statute of Provisors or in other ways. He
supported Bedford in his attempts to restore order to the finances.
In August 1435 he attended the congress at Arras, but was unable
to make peace with France; and after Bedford&rsquo;s death his
renewed efforts to this end were again opposed by Gloucester, who
favoured a continuance of the war. On two occasions the council
advised the king to refuse him permission to leave England, but
in 1437 he obtained a full pardon for all his offences. In 1439 and
1440 he went to France on missions of peace, and apparently at
his instigation the English council decided to release Charles,
duke of Orleans. This step further irritated Gloucester, who drew
up and presented to the king a long and serious list of charges
against Beaufort; but the council defended the policy of the
cardinal and ignored the personal accusations against him.
Beaufort, however, gradually retired from public life, and after
witnessing the conclusion of the treaty of Troyes died at Wolvesey
palace, Winchester, on the 10th of April 1447. The &ldquo;black
despair&rdquo; which Shakespeare has cast round his dying hours
appears to be without historical foundation. He was buried in
Winchester cathedral, the building of which he finished. He
also refounded and enlarged the hospital of St Cross near
Winchester.</p>

<p>Beaufort was a man of considerable wealth, and on several
occasions he lent large sums of money to the king. He was the
lover of Lady Alice Fitzalan, daughter of Richard, earl of
Arundel, by whom he had a daughter, Joan, who married Sir
Edward Stradling of St Donat&rsquo;s in Glamorganshire. His
interests were secular and he was certainly proud and ambitious;
but Stubbs has pictured the fairer side of his character when he
observes that Beaufort &ldquo;was merciful in his political enmities,
enlightened in his foreign policy; that he was devotedly faithful,
and ready to sacrifice his wealth and labour for the king; that
from the moment of his death everything began to go wrong, and
went worse and worse until all was lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUFORT, LOUIS DE<a name="ar193" id="ar193"></a></span> (d. 1795), French historian, of whose
life little is known. In 1738 he published at Utrecht a <i>Dissertation
sur l&rsquo;incertitude des cinq premiers siècles de l&rsquo;histoire romaine</i>,
in which he showed what untrustworthy guides even the historians
of highest repute, such as Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
were for that period, and pointed out by what methods
and by the aid of what documents truly scientific bases might be
given to its history. This was an ingenious plea, bold for its time,
against traditional history such as Rollin was writing at that very
moment. A German, Christopher Saxius, endeavoured to refute
it in a series of articles published in vols. i.-iii. of the <i>Miscellanea
Liviensia</i>. Beaufort replied by some brief and ironical <i>Remarques</i>
in the appendix to the second edition of his <i>Dissertation</i> (1750).
Beaufort also wrote an <i>Histoire de César Germanicus</i> (Leyden,
1761), and <i>La République romaine, ou plan général de L&rsquo;ancien
gouvernement de Rome</i> (The Hague, 1766, 2 vols. quarto). Though
not a scholar of the first rank, Beaufort has at least the merit of
having been a pioneer in raising the question, afterwards elaborated
by Niebuhr, as to the credibility of early Roman history.</p>

capital of a division of this name, 339 m. by rail N.E. of Cape
Town. Pop.(1904) 5481. The largest town in the western part
of the Great Karroo, it lies, at an elevation of 2792 ft., at the foot
of the southern slopes of the Nieuwveld mountains. It has several
fine public buildings and the streets are lined with avenues of
pear trees, while an abundant supply of water, luxuriant orchards,
fields and gardens give it the appearance of an oasis in the desert.
It is a favourite resort of invalids. The town was founded in 1819,
and in its early days was largely resorted to by Griquas and
Bechuana for the sale of ivory, skins and cattle. The Beaufort
West division has an area of 6374 sq. m. and a pop. (1904) of
10,762, 45% being whites. Sheep-farming is the principal

Loiret, 16 m. S.W. of Orleans on the Orleans railway, between
that city and Blois. Pop. (1906) 2993. It is situated at the foot
of vine-clad hills on the right bank of the Loire, to the left bank of
which it is united by a bridge of twenty-six arches, many of them
dating from the 13th century. The chief buildings are the
château, mainly of the 15th century, of which the massive donjon
of the 11th century known as the Tour de César is the oldest
portion; and the abbey-church of Notre-Dame, a building in the
Romanesque style of architecture, frequently restored. Some of
the buildings of the Benedictine abbey, to which this church
belonged, remain. The hôtel de ville, the façade of which is
decorated with armorial bearings of Renaissance carving, and the
church of St Étienne, an unblemished example of Romanesque
architecture, are of interest. Several old houses, some remains of
the medieval ramparts and the Tour de l&rsquo;Horloge, an ancient
gateway, are also preserved. The town carries on trade in grain,
and has flour mills.</p>

<p>The lords of Beaugency attained considerable importance in
the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries; at the end of the 13th century
the fief was sold to the crown, and afterwards passed to the
house of Orleans, then to those of Dunois and Longueville and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page588" id="page588"></a>588</span>
ultimately again to that of Orleans. Joan of Arc defeated the
English here in 1429. In 1567 the town was sacked and burned
by the Protestants. On the 8th, 9th and 10th of December
1870 the German army, commanded by the grand-duke of
Mecklenburg, defeated the French army of the Loire, under
General Chanzy, in the battle of Beaugency (or Villorceau-Josnes),

<p><span class="bold">BEAUHARNAIS,<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> the name of a French family, well known

occupied honourable positions. One of them, Jean Jacques de
Beauharnais, seigneur de Miramion, had for wife Marie Bonneau,
who in 1661 founded a female charitable order, called after her
the Miramiones. François de Beauharnais, marquis de la
Ferté-Beauharnais, was a deputy in the states-general of 1789, and a
devoted defender of the monarchy. He emigrated and served
in Condé&rsquo;s army. Later he gave his adherence to Napoleon, and
became ambassador in Etruria and Spain; he died in 1823. His
brother Alexandre, vicomte de Beauharnais, married Josephine
Tascher de la Pagerie (afterwards the wife of Napoleon
Bonaparte) and had two children by her&mdash;Eugène de
Beauharnais (<i>q.v.</i>) and Hortense, who married Louis Bonaparte,
king of Holland, and became mother of Napoleon III. Claude de
Beauharnais, comte des Roches-Baritaud, uncle of the marquis
and of the vicomte de Beauharnais, served in the navy and
became a vice-admiral. He married Marie Anne Françoise
(called Fanny) Mouchard, a woman of letters who had a celebrated
salon. His son, also named Claude (d. 1819), was created a peer
of France in 1814, and was the father of Stéphanie de
Beauharnais, who married the grand-duke of Baden. The house of
Beauharnais is still represented in Russia by the dukes of

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEAUHARNAIS, EUGÈNE DE<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> (1781-1824), step-son of
Napoleon I., was born at Paris on the 3rd of September 1781.
He was the son of the general Viscount Alexandre de Beauharnais
(1760-1794) and Josephine Tascher de la Pagerie. The
father, who was born in Martinique, and served in the American
War of Independence, took part in the politics of the French
Revolution, and in June-August 1793 commanded the army
of the Rhine. His failure to fulfil the tasks imposed on him
(especially that of the relief of Mainz) led to his being arrested,
and he was guillotined (23rd June 1794) not long before the fall
of Robespierre. The marriage of his widow Josephine to
Napoleon Bonaparte in March 1796 was at first resented by
Eugène and his sister Hortense; but their step-father proved
to be no less kind than watchful over their interests. In the
Italian campaigns of 1796-1797 Eugène served as aide-de-camp
to Bonaparte, and accompanied him to Egypt in the same
capacity. There he distinguished himself by his activity and
bravery, and was wounded during the siege of Acre. Bonaparte
brought him back to France in the autumn of 1799, and it is
known that the intervention of Eugène and Hortense helped
to bring about the reconciliation which then took place between
Bonaparte and Josephine. The services rendered by Eugène
at the time of the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of Brumaire (1799) and during the
Consulate (1799-1804) served to establish his fortunes, despite
the efforts of some of the Bonapartes to destroy the influence
of the Beauharnais and bring about the divorce of Josephine.</p>

<p>After the proclamation of the Empire, Eugène received the
title of prince, with a yearly stipend of 200,000 francs, and
became general of the <i>chasseurs à cheval</i> of the Guard. A year
later, when the Italian republic became the kingdom of Italy,
with Napoleon as king, Eugène received the title of viceroy,
with large administrative powers. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Italy</a></span>.) Not long after
the battle of Austerlitz (2nd December 1805) Napoleon dignified
the elector of Bavaria with the title of king and arranged a
marriage between Eugène and the princess Augusta Amelia of
Bavaria. On the whole the government of Eugène gave general
satisfaction in the kingdom of Italy; it comprised the districts
between the Simplon Pass and Rimini, and also after the peace
of Presburg (December 1805), Istria and Dalmatia. In 1808
(on the further partition of the papal states) the frontier of the
kingdom was extended southwards to the borders of the kingdom
of Naples, in the part known as the Abruzzi. In the campaign
of 1809 Eugène commanded the army of Italy, with General
(afterwards Marshal) Macdonald as his <i>adlatus</i>. The battle of
Sacile, where he fought against the Austrian army of the Archduke
John, did not yield proofs of military talent on the part
of Eugène or of Macdonald; but on the retreat of the enemy
into Austrian territory (owing to the disasters of their main
army on the Danube) Eugène&rsquo;s forces pressed them vigorously
and finally won an important victory at Raab in the heart of the
Austrian empire. Then, joining the main army under Napoleon,
in the island of Lobau in the Danube, near Vienna, Eugène and
Macdonald acquitted themselves most creditably in the great
battle of Wagram (6th July 1809). In 1810 Eugène received
the title of grand-duke of Frankfort. Equally meritorious were
his services and those of the large Italian contingent in the
campaign of 1812 in Russia. He and they distinguished themselves
especially at the battles of Borodino and Malojaroslavitz;
and on several occasions during the disastrous retreat which
ensued, Eugène&rsquo;s soldierly constancy and devotion to Napoleon
shone out conspicuously in 1813-1814, especially by contrast
with the tergiversations of Murat. On the downfall of the
Napoleonic régime Eugène retired to Munich, where he continued
to reside, with the title duke of Leuchtenberg and prince of
Eichstädt. He died in 1824, leaving two surviving sons and three
daughters.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUJEU<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span>. The French province of Beaujolais was formed
by the development of the ancient seigniory of Beaujeu (department
of Rhône, arrondissement of Villefranche). The lords of
Beaujeu held from the 10th century onwards a high rank in
feudal society. In 1210 Guichard of Beaujeu was sent by Philip
Augustus on an embassy to Pope Innocent III.; he was present
at the French attack on Dover, where he died in 1216. His son
Humbert took part in the wars against the Albigenses and
became constable of France. Isabeau, daughter of this Humbert,
married Renaud, count of Forez; and their second son, Louis,
assumed the name and arms of Beaujeu. His son Guichard,
called the Great, had a very warlike life, fighting for the king of
France, for the count of Savoy and for his own hand. He was
taken prisoner by the Dauphinois in 1325, thereby losing
important estates. Guichard&rsquo;s son, Edward of Beaujeu, marshal
of France, fought at Crécy, and perished in the battle of Ardres
in 1351. His son died without issue in 1374, and was succeeded
by his cousin, Edward of Beaujeu, lord of Perreux, who gave
his estates of Beaujolais and Dombes to Louis II., duke of
Bourbon, in 1400. Pierre de Bourbon was lord of Beaujeu in
1474, when he married Anne of France, daughter of Louis XI.,
and this is why that princess retained the name of lady of
Beaujeu. Louise of Savoy, mother of Francis I., got Beaujolais
assigned to herself despite the claims of the constable de Bourbon.
In 1531 the province was reunited to the crown; but Francis II.
gave it back to the Montpensier branch of the Bourbons in 1560,
from which house it passed to that of Orleans. The title of
comte de Beaujolais was borne by a son of Philippe &ldquo;Égalité,&rdquo;
duke of Orleans, born in 1779, died in 1808.</p>

Pop. (1906) 1460. It is about 4 m. by rail E. of
Nice (1¼ m. from Villefranche), and on the main line between
Marseilles and Mentone; it is also connected with Nice and
Mentone by an electric tramway. Of late years it has become
a much frequented winter resort, and many handsome villas
(among them that built by the 3rd marquess of Salisbury) have
been constructed in the neighbourhood. The harbour has been
extended and adapted for the reception of yachts.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAULY<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span> (pronounced <i>Bewley</i>; a corruption of <i>Beaulieu</i>), a
town of Inverness-shire, Scotland, on the Beauly, 10 m. W. of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page589" id="page589"></a>589</span>
Inverness by the Highland railway. Pop. (1901) 855. Its
chief interest is the beautiful remains of the Priory of St John,
founded in 1230 by John Bisset of the Aird, for Cistercian monks.
At the Reformation the buildings (except the church, now a
ruin) passed into the possession of Lord Lovat. On the right
bank of the river is the site of Lovat Castle, which once belonged
to the Bissets, but was presented by James VI. to Hugh Fraser
and afterwards demolished. To the south-east is the church of
Kirkhill containing the vault of the Lovats. Three miles south
of Beauly is Beaufort Castle, the chief seat of the Lovats, a fine
modern mansion in the Scottish baronial style. It occupies the
site of a fortress erected in the time of Alexander II., which was
besieged in 1303 by Edward I. This was replaced by several
castles in succession, of which one&mdash;Castle Dounie&mdash;was taken
by Cromwell and burned by the duke of Cumberland in 1746,
the conflagration being witnessed from a neighbouring hill by
Simon, Lord Lovat, before his capture on Loch Morar. The
land around Beauly is fertile and the town drives a brisk trade in
coal, timber, lime, grain and fish.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUMANOIR,<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> a seigniory in what is now the department of
Côtes-du-Nord, France, which gave its name to an illustrious
family. Jean de Beaumanoir, marshal of Brittany for Charles of
Blois, and captain of Josselin, is remembered for his share in the
famous battle of the Thirty. This battle, sung by an unknown
trouvère and retold with variations by Froissart, was an episode
in the struggle for the succession to the duchy of Brittany
between Charles of Blois, supported by the king of France, and
John of Montfort, supported by the king of England. John
Bramborough, the English captain of Ploërmel, having continued
his ravages, in spite of a truce, in the district commanded by the
captain of Josselin, Jean de Beaumanoir sent him a challenge,
which resulted in a fight between thirty picked champions,
knights and squires, on either side, which took place on the 25th
of March 1351, near Ploërmel. Beaumanoir commanded thirty
Bretons, Bramborough a mixed force of twenty Englishmen, six
German mercenaries and four Breton partisans of Montfort. The
battle, fought with swords, daggers and axes, was of the most
desperate character, in its details very reminiscent of the last
fight of the Burgundians in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, especially
in the celebrated advice of Geoffrey du Bois to his wounded leader, who
was asking for water: &ldquo;Drink your blood, Beaumanoir; that
will quench your thirst!&rdquo; In the end the victory was decided by
Guillaume de Montauban, who mounted his horse and overthrew
seven of the English champions, the rest being forced to surrender.
All the combatants on either side were either dead or seriously
wounded, Bramborough being among the slain. The prisoners
were well treated and released on payment of a small ransom.

Froissart, <i>Chroniques</i>, ed. S. Luce, c. iv. pp. 45 and 110 ff., and pp. 338-340).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean de Beaumanoir</span> (1551-1614), seigneur and afterwards
marquis de Lavardin, count of Nègrepelisse by marriage, served
first in the Protestant army, but turned Catholic after the
massacre of St Bartholomew, in which his father had been killed,
and then fought against Henry of Navarre. When that prince
became king of France, Lavardin changed over to his side, and
was made a marshal of France. He was governor of Maine,
commanded an army in Burgundy in 1602, was ambassador
extraordinary to England in 1612, and died in 1614. One of his
descendants, Henry Charles, marquis de Lavardin (1643-1701),
was sent as ambassador to Rome in 1689, on the occasion of a
difference between Louis XIV. and Innocent XI.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUMANOIR, PHILIPPE DE RÉMI,<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> <span class="sc">Sire de</span> (<i>c.</i> 1250-1296),
French jurist, was born in the early part of the 13th
century and died in 1296. The few facts known regarding his
life are to be gathered from legal documents in which his name
occurs. From these it appears that in 1273 he filled the post of
<i>bailli</i> at Senlis, and in 1280 held a similar office at Clermont. He
is also occasionally referred to as presiding at the assizes held at
various towns. His great work is entitled <i>Coutumes de Beauvoisis</i>
and first appeared in 1690, a second edition with introduction by
A.A. Beugnot being published in 1842. It is regarded as one of
the best works bearing on old French law, and was frequently
referred to with high admiration by Montesquieu. Beaumanoir
also obtained fame as a poet, and left over 20,000 verses, the best
known of his poems being <i>La Manekine</i>, <i>Jehan et Blonde</i> and <i>Salut d&rsquo;amour</i>.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEAUMARCHAIS, PIERRE AUGUSTIN CARON DE<a name="ar204" id="ar204"></a></span> (1732-1799),
French dramatist, was born in Paris on the 24th of
January 1732. His father, a watchmaker named Caron, brought
him up to the same trade. He was an unusually precocious and
lively boy, shrewd, sagacious, passionately fond of music and
imbued with a strong desire for rising in the world. At the age of
twenty-one he invented a new escapement for watches, which
was pirated by a rival maker. Young Caron at once published
his grievance in the <i>Mercure</i>, and had the matter referred to the
Academy of Sciences, which decided in his favour. This affair
brought him into notice at court; he was appointed, or at least
called himself, watchmaker to the king, who ordered from him a
watch similar to one he had made for Mme de Pompadour. His
handsome figure and cool assurance enabled him to make his way
at court. Mme Franquet, the wife of an old court official,
persuaded her husband to make over his office to young Caron,
and, on her husband&rsquo;s death, a few months later, married the
handsome watchmaker. Caron at the same time assumed the
name Beaumarchais; and four years later, by purchasing the
office of secretary to the king obtained a patent of nobility.</p>

<p>At court his musical talents brought him under the notice of
the king&rsquo;s sisters, who engaged him to teach them the harp. This
position enabled him to confer a slight favour on the great banker
Joseph Duverney, who testified his gratitude by giving Beaumarchais
a share in his speculations. The latter turned the
opportunity to good account, and soon realized a handsome
fortune. In 1764 he took a journey to Spain, partly with
commercial objects in view, but principally on account of the
Clavijo affair. José Clavijo y Fajardo had twice promised to
marry the sister of Beaumarchais, and had failed to keep his word.
The adventure had not the tragic ending of Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Clavigo</i>, for
Beaumarchais did not pursue his vengeance beyond words.
Beaumarchais made his first essay as a writer for the stage with
the sentimental drama <i>Eugénie</i> (1767), in which he drew largely
on the Clavijo incident. This was followed after an interval of
two years by <i>Les Deux Amis</i>, but neither play had more than
moderate success. His first wife had died within a year of the
marriage and in 1768 Beaumarchais married Mme Lévêque.
Her death in 1771 was the signal for unfounded rumours of
poisoning. Duverney died in 1770; but some time before his
death a duplicate settlement of the affairs between him and
Beaumarchais had been drawn up, in which the banker acknowledged
himself debtor to Beaumarchais for 15,000 francs.
Duverney&rsquo;s heir, the comte de La Blache, denied the validity of
the document though without directly stigmatizing it as a
forgery. The matter was put to trial. Beaumarchais gained his
cause, but his adversary at once carried the case before the
parlement. In the meantime the duc de Chaulnes forced
Beaumarchais into a quarrel over Mdlle Menard, an actress at the
Comédie Italienne, which resulted in the imprisonment of both
parties. This moment was chosen by La Blache to demand
judgment from the parlement in the matter of the Duverney
agreement. Beaumarchais was released from prison for three or
four days to see his judges. He was, however, unable to obtain
an interview with Goezman, the member of the parlement
appointed to report on his case. At last, just before the day on
which the report was to be given in, he was informed privately
that, by presenting 200 <i>louis</i> to Mme Goezman and 15 to her
secretary, the desired interview might take place, if the result
should prove unfavourable the money would be refunded. The
money was sent and the interview obtained; but the decision
was adverse, and 200 <i>louis</i> were returned, the 15 going as business
expenses to the secretary. Beaumarchais, who had learned that
there was no secretary save Mme Goezman herself, insisted on
restitution of the 15 <i>louis</i>, but the lady denied all knowledge of
the affair. Her husband, who was probably not cognisant of the
details of the transaction at first, doubtless thought the defeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page590" id="page590"></a>590</span>
litigant would be easily put down, and at once brought an
accusation against him for an attempt to corrupt justice. The
battle was fought chiefly through the <i>Mémoires</i>, or reports
published by the adverse parties, and in it Beaumarchais&rsquo;s
success was complete. For vivacity of style, fine satire and
broad humour, his famous <i>Mémoires</i>  have never been surpassed.
Even Voltaire was constrained to envy them. Beaumarchais
was skilful enough to make his particular case of universal
application. He was attacking the parlement through one of its
members, and the parlement was the universally detested body
formed by the chancellor Maupeou. The <i>Mémoires</i> were,
therefore, hailed with general delight; and the author, from
being perhaps the most unpopular man in France, became at once
the idol of the people. The decision went against Beaumarchais.
The parlement condemned both him and Mme Goezman <i>au
blâme</i>, <i>i.e.</i> to civic degradation, while the husband was obliged
to abandon his position. Beaumarchais was reduced to great
straits, but he obtained restitution of his rights within two years,
and finally triumphed over his adversary La Blache.</p>

<p>During the next few years he was engaged in the king&rsquo;s
secret service. One of his missions was to England to destroy
the <i>Mémoires secrets d&rsquo;une femme publique</i> in which Charles
Theveneau de Morande made an attack on Mme Du Barry.
Beaumarchais secured this pamphlet, and burnt the whole
impression in London. Another expedition to England and
Holland to seize a pamphlet attacking Marie Antoinette
led to a series of incidents more amazing than the intrigues
in Beaumarchais&rsquo;s own plays, but his own account must
be received with caution. Beaumarchais pursued the libeller
to Germany and overtook him in a wood near Neustadt. After
a struggle he had gained possession of the document when he
was attacked by brigands. Unfortunately the wound alleged
to have been received in this fight was proved to be self-inflicted.
The Austrian government regarded Beaumarchais with a
suspicion justified by the circumstances. He was imprisoned
for some time in Vienna, and only released on the receipt of
explanations from Paris.</p>

<p>His various visits to England led him to take a deep interest
in the impending struggle between the American colonies and
the mother-country. His sympathies were entirely with the
former; and by his unwearied exertions he succeeded in inducing
the French government to give ample, though private, assistance
in money and arms to the Americans. He himself, partly on
his own account, but chiefly as the agent of the French and
Spanish governments, carried on an enormous traffic with
America. Under the name of Rodrigue Hortalez et Cie,
he employed a fleet of forty vessels to provide help for the
insurgents.</p>

<p>During the same period he produced his two famous comedies.
The earlier, <i>Le Barbier de Seville</i>, after a prohibition of two years,
was put on the stage in 1775. The first representation was a
complete failure. Beaumarchais had overloaded the last scene
with allusions to the facts of his own case and the whole action
of the piece was laboured and heavy. But he cut down and
remodelled the piece in time for the second representation, when
it achieved a complete success. The intrigues which were
necessary in order to obtain a licence for the second and more
famous comedy, <i>Le Mariage de Figaro</i>, are highly amusing, and
throw much light on the unsettled state of public sentiment at
the time. The play was completed in 1778, but the opposition
of Louis XVI., who alone saw its dangerous tendencies, was not
overcome till 1784. The comedy had an unprecedented success.
The principal character in both plays, Figaro, is a completely
original conception; in fact Beaumarchais drew a portrait of
himself in the resourceful adventurer, who, for mingled wit,
shrewdness, gaiety and philosophic reflection, may not unjustly
be ranked with Tartuffe. To English readers the Figaro plays
are generally known through the adaptations of them in the
grand opera of Mozart and Rossini; but in France they long
retained popularity as acting pieces. The success of <i>Le Mariage
de Figaro</i> was helped on by the methods of self-advertisement
so well understood by Beaumarchais. The proceeds of the
fiftieth performance were devoted to a charity, the choice of
which provoked numerous epigrams. Beaumarchais had the
imprudence to retaliate by personalities that were reported by
his enemies to be dedicated against the king and queen. Beaumarchais
was imprisoned for a short time by royal order in the
prison of St Lazare. Brilliant pamphleteer as he was, Beaumarchais
was at last to meet more than his match. He undertook
to defend the company of the &ldquo;Eaux de Paris,&rdquo; in which he had
a large interest, against Mirabeau, and brought down on himself
an invective to which he could offer no reply. His real influence
was gone from that date (1785-1786). Shortly afterwards he
was violently attacked by Nicolas Bergasse, whom he sued for
defamation of character. He gained his case, but his reputation
had suffered in the pamphlet war. Beaumarchais&rsquo;s later productions,
the bombastic opera <i>Tarare</i> (1787) and the drama <i>La
Mère coupable</i> (1792), which was very popular, are in no way
worthy of his genius.</p>

<p>By his writings Beaumarchais contributed greatly, though
quite unconsciously, to hurry on the events that led to the
Revolution. At heart he hardly seems to have been a republican,
and the new state of affairs did not benefit him. The astonishing
thing is that the society travestied in <i>Le Mariage de Figaro</i> was
the most vehement in its applause. The court looked on at a
play justly characterized by Napoleon as the &ldquo;revolution
already in action&rdquo; apparently without a suspicion of its real
character. His popularity had been destroyed by the Mirabeau
and Bergasse affairs, and his great wealth exposed him to the
enmity of the envious. A speculation into which he entered,
to supply the Convention with muskets from Holland, proved
a ruinous failure. He was accused of concealing arms and corn
in his house, but when his house was searched nothing was
discovered but some thousands of copies of the edition (1783-1790)
of the works of Voltaire which he had had printed at his
private press at Kehl, in Baden. He was charged with treason
to the republic and was imprisoned in the Abbaye on the 20th
of August 1792. A week later he was released at the intercession
of Mme Houret de la Marinière, who had been his mistress. He
took refuge in Holland and England. His memoirs entitled,
<i>Mes six époques</i>, detailing his sufferings under the republic, are
not unworthy of the Goezman period. His courage and happy
disposition never deserted him, although he was hunted as an
agent of the Convention in Holland and England, while in Paris
he was proscribed as an <i>émigré</i>. He returned to Paris in 1796,
and died there, suddenly, on the 18th of May 1799.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUMARIS,<a name="ar205" id="ar205"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough, and the
county town of Anglesey, N. Wales, situated on the Bay of
Beaumaris, not far from Penmon, the northern entrance of the
Menai Strait. Pop. (1901) 2326. It has but one considerable
street. The large castle chapel, dedicated to the Virgin, has
some fine monuments. David Hughes, of Jesus College, Oxford,
founded the free grammar school in 1603. Buildings include
town-hall and county-hall, with St Mary&rsquo;s church of the 13th
century, with chancel of the 16th. Practically without trade
and with no manufactures, Beaumaris is principally noted as a
bathing-place. Its earliest charter dates from 1283 and was
revised under Elizabeth. The town was formerly called Barnover
and, still earlier, Rhosfair, and bears its present name of French
origin since Edward I. built its castle in 1293. This extensive
building was erected on low ground, so that the fosse might
communicate with the sea, and vessels might unload under its
walls. The castle capitulated, after siege, to General Mytton
(1646).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUMONT,<a name="ar206" id="ar206"></a></span> <span class="sc">Belmont</span>, or <span class="sc">Bellomont</span>, the name of a
Norman and English family, taken from Beaumont-le-Roger in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page591" id="page591"></a>591</span>
Normandy. Early in the 11th century Roger de Beaumont, a
kinsman of the dukes of Normandy, married a daughter of
Waleran, count of Meulan, and their son, <span class="sc">Robert de Beaumont</span>
(d. 1118), became count of Meulan or Mellent about 1080.
Before this date, however, he had fought at Hastings, and had
added large estates in Warwickshire to the Norman fiefs of
Beaumont and Pont Audemer, which he received when his
father entered the abbey of St Peter at Préaux. It was during
the reigns of William II. and Henry I. that the count rose to
eminence, and under the latter monarch he became &ldquo;the first
among the counsellors of the king.&rdquo; A &ldquo;strenuous and sagacious
man&rdquo; he rendered valuable service to both kings in their Norman
wars, and Henry I. was largely indebted to him for the
English crown. He obtained lands in Leicestershire, and it has
been said he was created earl of Leicester; this statement,
however, is an error, although he exercised some of the privileges
of an earl. His abilities as a counsellor, statesman and diplomatist
gained him the admiration of his contemporaries, and
Henry of Huntingdon describes him as &ldquo;the wisest man between
this and Jerusalem.&rdquo; He seems to have been a man of independent
character, for he assisted Anselm against William Rufus,
although he supported Henry I. in his quarrel with Pope Paschal
II. When Robert died on the 5th of June 1118 his lands appear
to have been divided between his twin sons, Robert and Waleran,
while a third son, Hugh, became earl of Bedford in 1138.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Robert de Beaumont</span> (1104-1168), justiciar of England,
married a granddaughter of Ralph Guader, earl of Norfolk, and
receiving his father&rsquo;s English fiefs in 1118 became earl of
Leicester. He and his brother, Waleran, were the chief advisers
of Stephen, and helped this king to seize the bishops of Salisbury
and Lincoln in 1139; later, however, Robert made his peace with
Henry II., and became chief justiciar of England. First among
the lay nobles he signed the Constitutions of Clarendon, he sought
to reconcile Henry and Archbishop Becket, and was twice in
charge of the kingdom during the king&rsquo;s absences in France.
The earl founded the abbey of St Mary de Pré at Leicester and
other religious houses, and by a charter confirmed the burgesses
of Leicester in the possession of their merchant-gild and customs.
His son, Robert, succeeded to the earldom of Leicester, and with
other English barons assisted prince Henry in his revolt against
his father the king in 1173. For this participation, and also
on a later occasion, he was imprisoned; but he enjoyed the
favour of Richard I., and died in Greece when returning from a
pilgrimage in 1190. His son and heir, Robert, died childless
in 1204.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Waleran de Beaumont</span> (1104-1166) obtained his father&rsquo;s
French fiefs and the title of count of Meulan in 1118. After
being imprisoned for five years by Henry I. he spent some time
in England, and during the civil war between Stephen and the
empress Matilda he fought for the former until about 1150,
when he deserted the king and assisted the empress. His later
history appears to have been uneventful. The county of Meulan
remained in possession of the Beaumont family until 1204, when
it was united with the royal domain.</p>

<p>Another member of the Beaumont family, possibly a relative
of the earlier Beaumonts, was <span class="sc">Louis de Beaumont</span> (d. 1333),
bishop of Durham from 1317 until his death. This prelate was
related to the English king, Edward II., and after a life spent
in strife and ostentation, he died on the 24th of September 1333.
<span class="sc">John Beaumont</span>, master of the rolls under Edward VI., was
probably a member of the same family. A dishonest and corrupt
judge, he was deprived of his office and imprisoned in 1552.</p>

<p>The barony of Beaumont dates from 1309, when <span class="sc">Henry
Beaumont</span> (d. 1340), who was constable of England in 1322, was
summoned to parliament under this title. It was retained by
his descendants until the death of William, the 7th baron and
the 2nd viscount,<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in 1507, when it fell into abeyance. In 1840
the barony was revived in favour of Miles Thomas Stapleton (1805-1854),
a descendant of Joan, Baroness Lovel, a daughter
of the 6th baron, and it has since been retained by his descendants.</p>

<p>In 1906 <span class="sc">Wentworth Blackett Beaumont</span> (1829-1907), the
head of a family well known in the north of England, was created
Baron Allendale.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><span class="bold">BEAUMONT, CHRISTOPHE DE<a name="ar207" id="ar207"></a></span> (1703-1781), French ecclesiastic
and archbishop of Paris, was a cadet of the Les Adrets and
Saint-Quentin branch of the illustrious Dauphiné family of
Beaumont. He became bishop of Bayonne in 1741, then archbishop
of Vienne in 1743, and in 1746, at the age of forty-three,
archbishop of Paris. Beaumont is noted for his struggle with the
Jansenists. To force them to accept the bull <i>Unigenitus</i> which
condemned their doctrines, he ordered the priests of his diocese
to refuse absolution to those who would not recognize the bull,
and to deny funeral rites to those who had confessed to a
Jansenist priest. While other bishops sent Beaumont their
adhesion to his crusade, the parlement of Paris threatened to
confiscate his temporalities. The king forbade the parlement
to interfere in these spiritual questions, and upon its proving
obdurate it was exiled (September 18, 1753). The &ldquo;royal
chamber,&rdquo; which was substituted, having failed to carry on the
administration of justice properly, the king was obliged to recall
the parlement, and the archbishop was sent into honourable
exile (August 1754). An effort was made to induce him to
resign the active duties of his see to a coadjutor, but in spite
of the most tempting offers&mdash;including a cardinal&rsquo;s hat&mdash;he
refused. On the contrary, to his polemic against the Jansenists
he added an attack on the <i>philosophes</i>, and issued a formal
mandatory letter condemning Rousseau&rsquo;s <i>Émile</i>. Rousseau
replied in his masterly <i>Lettre à M. de Beaumont</i> (1762), in which
he insists that freedom of discussion in religious matters is
essentially more religious than the attempt to impose belief by
force.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUMONT, SIR JOHN<a name="ar208" id="ar208"></a></span> (1583-1627), English poet, second
son of the judge, Sir Francis Beaumont, was born at Grace-Dieu
in Leicestershire in 1583. The deaths of his father (in 1598)
and of his elder brother, Sir Henry Beaumont (in 1605), made
the poet early the head of this brilliant family; the dramatist,
Francis Beaumont, being a younger brother. John went to
Oxford in February 1597, and entered as a gentleman commoner
in Broadgates Hall, the present Pembroke College. He was
admitted to the Inner Temple in 1600, but on the death of Henry
he no doubt went down to Grace-Dieu to manage the family
estates. He began to write verse early, and in 1602, at the age
of nineteen, he published anonymously his <i>Metamorphosis of
Tabacco</i>, written in very smooth couplets, in which he addressed
Drayton as his &ldquo;loving friend.&rdquo; He lived in Leicestershire for
many years as a bachelor, being one &ldquo;who never felt Love&rsquo;s
dreadful arrow.&rdquo; But in process of time he became a tardy
victim, and married a lady of the Fortescue family, who bore
him four stout sons, the eldest of whom, another John, was
accounted one of the most athletic men of his time. &ldquo;He could
leap 16 ft. at one leap, and would commonly, at a stand-leap,
jump over a high long table in the hall, light on a settle beyond
the table, and raise himself straight up.&rdquo; This magnificent
young man was not without literary taste; he edited his father&rsquo;s
posthumous poems, and wrote an enthusiastic elegy on him; he
was killed in 1644 at the siege of Gloucester. Another of Sir
John Beaumont&rsquo;s sons, Gervaise, died in childhood, and the
incidents of his death are recorded in one of his father&rsquo;s most
touching poems. Sir John Beaumont concentrated his powers
on a poem in eight books, entitled <i>The Crown of Thorns</i>, which
was greatly admired in MS. by the earl of Southampton and
others, but which is lost. After long retirement, Beaumont was
persuaded by the duke of Buckingham to move in larger circles;
he attended court and in 1626 was made a baronet. This
honour he did not long survive, for he died on the 19th of April
1627, and was buried in Westminster Abbey ten days later.
The new Sir John, the strong man, published in 1629 a volume
entitled <i>Bosworth Field; with a taste of the variety of other Poems

No more &ldquo;tastes&rdquo; were ever vouchsafed, so that it is by this volume and by the juvenile
<i>Metamorphosis of Tobacco</i> that Beaumont&rsquo;s reputation has to
stand. Of late years, the peculiarities of John Beaumont&rsquo;s
prosody have drawn attention to his work. He wrote the heroic
couplet, which was his favourite measure, with almost unprecedented
evenness. Bosworth Field, the scene of the battle
of which Beaumont&rsquo;s principal poem gives a vaguely epical
narrative, lay close to the poet&rsquo;s house of Grace-Dieu. He
writes on all occasions with a smoothness which was very remarkable
in the first quarter of the 17th century, and which marks
him, with Edmund Waller and George Sandys, as one of the
pioneers of the classic reformation of English verse.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUMONT<a name="ar209" id="ar209"></a></span> and <b>FLETCHER,</b> English dramatists<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The
names of <span class="sc">Francis Beaumont</span> (1584-1616) and <span class="sc">John Fletcher</span>
(1579-1625) are inseparably connected in the history of the
English drama. John Fletcher was born in December 1579 at
Rye in Sussex, and baptized on the 20th of the same month.
Richard Fletcher, his father, afterwards queen&rsquo;s chaplain, dean
of Peterborough, and bishop successively of Bristol, Worcester
and London, was then minister of the parish in which the son was
born who was to make their name immortal. That son was just
turned of seven when the dean distinguished and disgraced
himself as the spiritual tormentor of the last moments on earth
of Mary Stuart. When not quite twelve he was admitted
pensioner of Bene&rsquo;t College, Cambridge, and two years later was
made one of the Bible-clerks: of this college Bishop Fletcher had
been president twenty years earlier, and six months before his
son&rsquo;s admission had received from its authorities a first letter of
thanks for various benefactions, to be followed next year by a
second. Four years later than this, when John Fletcher wanted
five or six months of his seventeenth year, the bishop died
suddenly of over much tobacco and the displeasure of Queen
Elizabeth at his second marriage&mdash;this time, it appears, with a
lady of such character as figures something too frequently on the
stage of his illustrious son. He left eight children by his first
marriage in such distress that their uncle, Dr Giles Fletcher,
author of a treatise on the Russian commonwealth which is still
held in some repute, was obliged to draw up a petition to the
queen on their behalf, which was supported by the intercession
of Essex, but with what result is uncertain.</p>

<p>From this date we know nothing of the fortunes of John
Fletcher, till the needy orphan boy of seventeen reappears as the
brilliant and triumphant poet whose name is linked for all time
with the yet more glorious name of Francis Beaumont, third and
youngest son of Sir Francis Beaumont of Grace-Dieu, one of the
justices of the common pleas&mdash;born, according to general report,
in 1586, but, according to more than one apparently irrefragable
document, actually born two years earlier. The first record of
his existence is the entry of his name, together with those of his
elder brothers Henry and John, as a gentleman-commoner of
Broadgates Hall, Oxford, now supplanted by Pembroke College.
But most lovers of his fame will care rather to remember the
admirable lines of Wordsworth on the &ldquo;eager child&rdquo; who played
among the rocks and woodlands of Grace-Dieu; though it may be
doubted whether even the boy&rsquo;s first verses were of the peaceful
and pastoral character attributed to them by the great laureate
of the lakes. That passionate and fiery genius which was so soon
and for so short a time to &ldquo;shake the buskined stage&rdquo; with heroic
and tragic notes of passion and of sorrow, of scorn and rage, and
slighted love and jealousy, must surely have sought vent from the
first in fancies of a more ardent and ambitious kind; and it
would be a likelier conjecture that when Frank Beaumont (as we
know on more authorities than one that he was always called by
his contemporaries, even in the full flush of his adult
fame&mdash;&ldquo;never more than Frank,&rdquo; says Heywood) went to college at the
ripe age of twelve, he had already committed a tragedy or two in
emulation of <i>Tamburlaine</i>, <i>Andronicus</i> or <i>Jeronymo</i>.
The date of his admission was the 4th of February 1597; on the 22nd
of April of the following year his father died; and on the 3rd of
November 1600, having left Oxford without taking his degree, the
boy of fifteen was entered a member of the Inner Temple, his two
brothers standing sponsors on the grave occasion. But the son
of Judge Beaumont was no fitter for success at the bar than the
son of Bishop Fletcher for distinction in the church: it is
equally difficult to imagine either poet invested with either
gown. Two years later appeared the poem of <i>Salmacis and Hermaphroditus</i>,
generally attributed to Beaumont, a voluptuous and voluminous
expansion of the Ovidian legend, not on the whole discreditable
to a lad of eighteen, fresh from the popular love-poems of
Marlowe and Shakespeare, which it naturally exceeds in
long-winded and fantastic diffusion of episodes and conceits. At
twenty-three Beaumont prefixed to the magnificent masterpiece
of Ben Jonson some noticeable verses in honour of his &ldquo;dear
friend&rdquo; the author; and in the same year (1607) appeared the
anonymous comedy of <i>The Woman-Hater</i>, usually assigned to
Fletcher alone; but being as it is in the main a crude and puerile
imitation of Jonson&rsquo;s manner, and certainly more like a man&rsquo;s
work at twenty-two than at twenty-eight, internal evidence
would seem to justify, or at least to excuse those critics who in
the teeth of high authority and tradition would transfer from
Fletcher to Beaumont the principal responsibility for this first
play that can be traced to the hand of either. As Fletcher also
prefixed to the first edition of <i>Volpone</i> a copy of commendatory
verses, we may presume that their common admiration for a common
friend was among the earliest and strongest influences
which drew together the two great poets whose names were
thenceforward to be for ever indivisible. During the dim eleven
years between the death of his father and the dawn of his fame,
we cannot but imagine that the career of Fletcher had been
unprosperous as well as obscure. From seventeen to twenty-eight
his youth may presumably have been spent in such painful
struggles for success, if not for sustenance, as were never known
to his younger colleague, who, as we have seen, was entered at
Oxford a few months after Fletcher must in all likelihood have
left Cambridge to try his luck in London: a venture most
probably resolved on as soon as the youth had found his family
reduced by the father&rsquo;s death to such ruinous straits that any
smoother course can hardly have been open to him. Entering
college at the same age as Fletcher had entered six years earlier,
Beaumont had before him a brighter and briefer line of life than
his elder. But whatever may have been their respective situations
when, either by happy chance or, as Dyce suggests, by the good
offices of Jonson, they were first brought together, their intimacy
soon became so much closer than that of ordinary brothers that
the household which they shared as bachelors was conducted on
such thoroughly communistic principles as might have satisfied
the most trenchant theorist who ever proclaimed as the cardinal
point of his doctrine, a complete and absolute community of bed
and board, with all goods thereto appertaining. But in the year
following that in which the two younger poets had united in
homage to Jonson, they had entered into a partnership of more
importance than this in &ldquo;the same clothes and cloak, &amp;c.,&rdquo; with
other necessaries of life specified by Aubrey.</p>

<p>In 1608, if we may trust the reckoning which seems trust-worthiest,
the twin stars of our stage rose visibly together for the
first time. The loveliest, though not the loftiest, of tragic plays
that we owe to the comrades or the successors of Shakespeare,
<i>Philaster</i>, has generally been regarded as the first-born
issue of their common genius. The noble tragedy of <i>Thierry and Theodoret</i>
has sometimes been dated earlier and assigned to Fletcher
alone; but we can be sure neither of the early date nor the single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page593" id="page593"></a>593</span>
authorship. The main body of the play, comprising both the
great scenes which throw out into full and final relief the character
of either heroine for perfect good or evil, bears throughout the
unmistakable image and superscription of Fletcher; yet there
are parts which for gravity and steady strength of style, for
reserve and temperance of effect, would seem to suggest the
collaboration of a calmer and more patient hand; and these more
equable and less passionate parts of the poem recall rather the
touch of Massinger than of Beaumont. In the second act, for
example, the regular structure of the verse, the even scheme of
the action, the exaggerated braggardism which makes of the hero
a mere puppet or mouthpiece of his own self-will, are all qualities
which, for better or for worse, remind us of the strength or the
weakness of a poet with whom we know that Fletcher, before or
after his alliance with Beaumont, did now and then work in
common. Even the Arbaces of Beaumont, though somewhat too
highly coloured, does not &ldquo;write himself down an ass,&rdquo; like
Thierry on his first entrance, after the too frequent fashion of
Massinger&rsquo;s braggarts and tyrants; does not proclaim at starting
or display with mere wantonness of exposure his more unlovely
qualities in the naked nature of their deformity. Compare also
the second with the first scene of the fourth act. In style and
metre this second scene is as good an example of Massinger as the
first is of Fletcher at his best. Observe especially in the elaborate
narrative of the pretended self-immolation of Ordella these
distinctive notes of the peculiar style of Massinger; the excess of
parenthetic sentences, no less than five in a space of twenty lines;
the classical common-place of allusion to Athens, Rome and
Sparta in one superfluous breath; the pure and vigorous but
somewhat level and prosaic order of language, with the use of
certain cheap and easy phrases familiar to Massinger as catchwords;
the flat and feeble terminations by means of which the
final syllable of one verse runs on into the next without more pause
or rhythm than in a passage of prose; the general dignity and
gravity of sustained and measured expression. These are the
very points in which the style of Massinger differs from that of
Fletcher; whose lightest and loosest verses do not overlap each
other without sensible distinction between the end of one line and
the beginning of the next; who is often too fluent and facile to
be choice or forcible in his diction, but seldom if ever prosaic or
conventional in phrase or allusion, and by no means habitually
given to weave thoughts within thoughts, knit sentence into
sentence, and hang whole paragraphs together by the help of loops
and brackets. From these indications we might infer that this
poem belongs altogether to a period later than the death of
Beaumont; though even during his friend&rsquo;s life it appears that
Fletcher was once at least allied with Massinger and two lesser
dramatists in the composition of a play, probably the <i>Honest
Man&rsquo;s Fortune</i>, of which the accounts are to be found in Henslowe&rsquo;s
papers.</p>

<p>Hardly eight years of toil and triumph of joyous and glorious
life were spared by destiny to the younger poet between the date
assigned to the first radiant revelation of his genius in <i>Philaster</i>
and the date which marks the end of all his labours. On the 6th
of March 1616 Francis Beaumont died&mdash;according to Jonson and
tradition, &ldquo;ere he was thirty years of age,&rdquo; but this we have seen
to be inconsistent with the registry of his entrance at Oxford. If
we may trust the elegiac evidence of friends, he died of his own
genius and fiery overwork of brain; yet from the magnificent and
masculine beauty of his portrait one should certainly never have
guessed that any strain of spirit or stress of invention could have
worn out so long before its time so fair and royal a temple for so
bright and affluent a soul. A student of physiognomy will not
fail to mark the points of likeness and of difference between the
faces of the two friends; both models of noble manhood, handsome
and significant in feature and expression alike;&mdash;Beaumont&rsquo;s
the statelier and serener of the two, with clear thoughtful eyes,
full arched brows, and strong aquiline nose, with a little cleft at
the tip; a grave and beautiful mouth, with full and finely curved
lips; the form of face a long pure oval, and the imperial head with
its &ldquo;fair large front&rdquo; and clustering hair set firm and carried high
with an aspect at once of quiet command and kingly observation:
Fletcher&rsquo;s a more keen and fervid face, sharper in outline every
way, with an air of bright ardour and glad fiery impatience;
sanguine and nervous, suiting the complexion and colour of hair;
the expression of the eager eyes and lips almost recalling that of a
noble hound in act to break the leash it strains at;&mdash;two heads as
lordly of feature and as expressive of aspect as any gallery of great
men can show. That spring of 1616, we may note in passing, was
the darkest that ever dawned upon England or the world; for,
just forty-eight days afterwards, it witnessed, on the 23rd of
April, the removal from earth of the mightiest genius that ever
dwelt among men. Scarcely more than a month and a half divided
the death-days of Beaumont and of Shakespeare. Some three
years earlier by Dyce&rsquo;s estimate, when about the age of twenty-nine,
Beaumont had married Ursula, daughter and co-heiress to
Henry Isley of Sundridge in Kent, by whom he left two daughters,
one of them posthumous. Fletcher survived his friend just nine
years and five months; he died &ldquo;in the great plague, 1625,&rdquo; and
was buried on the 29th of August in St Saviour&rsquo;s, Southwark; not,
as we might have wished, beside his younger fellow in fame, who
but three days after his untimely death had added another
deathless memory to the graves of our great men in Westminster
Abbey, which he had sung in such noble verse. Dying when just
four months short of forty-six, Fletcher had thus, as well as we
can now calculate, altogether some fourteen years and six months
more of life than the poet who divides with him the imperial
inheritance of their common glory.</p>

<p>The perfect union in genius and in friendship which has made
one name of the two names of these great twin brothers in song
is a thing so admirable and so delightful to remember, that
it would seem ungracious and unkindly to claim for either a
precedence which we may be sure he would have been eager to
disclaim. But if a distinction must be made between the
Dioscuri of English poetry, we must admit that Beaumont was
the twin of heavenlier birth. Only as Pollux was on one side a
demigod of diviner blood than Castor can it be said that on any
side Beaumont was a poet of higher and purer genius than
Fletcher; but so much must be allowed by all who have eyes
and ears to discern in the fabric of their common work a distinction
without a difference. Few things are stranger than the
avowal of so great and exquisite a critic as Coleridge, that he
could trace no faintest line of demarcation between the plays
which we owe mainly to Beaumont and the plays which we owe
solely to Fletcher. To others this line has always appeared in
almost every case unmistakable. Were it as hard and broad
as the line which marks off, for example, Shakespeare&rsquo;s part
from Fletcher&rsquo;s in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, the harmony would
of course be lost which now informs every work of their common
genius, and each play of their writing would be such another
piece of magnificent patchwork as that last gigantic heir of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s invention, the posthumous birth of his parting
Muse which was suckled at the breast of Fletcher&rsquo;s as a child of
godlike blood might be reared on the milk of a mortal mother&mdash;or
in this case, we might sometimes be tempted to say, of a she-goat
who left in the veins of the heaven-born suckling somewhat
too much of his nurse Amalthaea. That question however
belongs in any case more properly to the study of Shakespeare
than to the present subject in hand. It may suffice here to
observe that the contributions of Fletcher to the majestic temple
of tragedy left incomplete by Shakespeare show the lesser
workman almost equally at his best and at him worst, at his
weakest and at his strongest. In the plays which we know by
evidence surer than the most trustworthy tradition to be the
common work of Beaumont and Fletcher, there is indeed no
trace of such incongruous and incompatible admixture as leaves
the greatest example of romantic tragedy&mdash;for <i>Cymbeline</i> and
the <i>Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>, though not guiltless of blood, are in their
issues no more tragic than <i>Pericles</i> or the <i>Tempest</i>&mdash;a unique
instance of glorious imperfection, a hybrid of heavenly aid other
than heavenly breed, disproportioned and divine. But throughout
these noblest of the works inscribed generally with the names
of both dramatists we trace on every other page the touch of
a surer hand, we hear at every other turn the note of a deeper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page594" id="page594"></a>594</span>
voice, than we can ever recognize in the work of Fletcher alone.
Although the beloved friend of Jonson, and in the field of comedy
his loving and studious disciple, yet in that tragic field where his
freshest bays were gathered Beaumont was the worthiest and
the closest follower of Shakespeare. In the external but essential
matter of expression by rhythm and metre he approves himself
always a student of Shakespeare&rsquo;s second manner, of the style
in which the graver or tragic part of his historical or romantic
plays is mostly written; doubtless, the most perfect model that
can be studied by any poet who, like Beaumont, is great enough
to be in no danger of sinking to the rank of a mere copyist, but
while studious of the perfection set before him is yet conscious
of his own personal and proper quality of genius, and enters the
presence of the master not as a servant but as a son. The
general style of his tragic or romantic verse is as simple and
severe in its purity of note and regularity of outline as that of
Fletcher&rsquo;s is by comparison lax, effusive, exuberant. The
matchless fluency and rapidity with which the elder brother
pours forth the stream of his smooth swift verse gave probably
the first occasion for that foolish rumour which has not yet fallen
duly silent, but still murmurs here and there its suggestion that
the main office of Beaumont was to correct and contain within
bounds the overflowing invention of his colleague. The poet
who while yet a youth had earned by his unaided mastery of
hand such a crown as was bestowed by the noble love and the
loving &ldquo;envy&rdquo; of Ben Jonson was, according to this tradition,
a mere precocious pedagogue, fit only to revise and restrain the
too liberal effusions of his elder in genius as in years. Now, in
every one of the plays common to both, the real difficulty for a
critic is not to trace the hand of Beaumont, but to detect the
touch of Fletcher. Throughout the better part of every such
play, and above all of their two masterpieces, <i>Philaster</i>
and <i>The Maid&rsquo;s Tragedy</i>, it should be clear to the most
sluggish or cursory of readers that he has not to do with the
author of <i>Valentinian</i> and <i>The Double Marriage</i>.
In those admirable tragedies the style is looser, more
fluid, more feminine. From the first scene to the last we
are swept as it were along the race of a running river, always
at full flow of light and buoyant melody, with no dark reaches
or perilous eddies, no stagnant pools or sterile sandbanks;
its bright course only varied by sudden rapids or a stronger
ripple here and there, but in rough places or smooth
still stirred and sparkling with summer wind and sun. But in
those tragic poems of which the dominant note is the note of
Beaumont&rsquo;s genius a subtler chord of thought is sounded, a
deeper key of emotion is touched, than ever was struck by
Fletcher. The lighter genius is palpably subordinate to the
stronger, and loyally submits itself to the impression of a loftier
spirit. It is true that this distinction is never grave enough to
produce a discord: it is also true that the plays in which the
predominance of Beaumont&rsquo;s mind and style is generally perceptible
make up altogether but a small section of the work that
bears their names conjointly; but it is no less true that within
this section the most precious part of that work is comprised.
Outside it we shall find no figures so firmly drawn, no such
clearness of outline, no such cunning of hands as we recognize
in the three great studies of Bellario, Evadne and Aspatia. In
his male characters, as for instance in the parts of Philaster and
Arbaces, Beaumont also is apt to show something of that
exaggeration or inconsistency for which his colleague is perhaps
more frequently and more heavily to blame; but in these there
is not a jarring note, not a touch misplaced; unless, indeed, a
rigid criticism may condemn as unfeminine and incongruous with
the gentle beauty of her pathetic patience the device by which
Aspatia procures herself the death desired at the hand of
Amintor. This is noted as a fault by Dyce; but may well be
forgiven for the sake of the magnificent scene which follows, and
the highest tragic effect ever attained on the stage of either poet.
That this as well as the greater part of those other scenes which
are the glory of the poem is due to Beaumont might readily be
shown at length by the process of comparison. The noble scene
of regicide, which it was found expedient to cancel during the
earlier years of the Restoration, may indeed be the work of
Fletcher; but the part of Evadne must undoubtedly be in the
main assigned to the more potent hand of his fellow. There is
a fine harmony of character between her naked audacity in the
second act and her fierce repentance in the fourth, which is
not unworthy a disciple of the tragic school of Shakespeare;
Fletcher is less observant of the due balance, less heedful of the
nice proportions of good and evil in a faulty and fiery nature,
compounded of perverse instinct and passionate reaction. From
him we might have had a figure as admirable for vigour of
handling, but hardly in such perfect keeping as this of Beaumont&rsquo;s
Evadne, the murderess-Magdalen, whose penitence is of
one crimson colour with her sin. Nor even in Fletcher&rsquo;s Ordella,
worthy as the part is throughout even of the precious and
exquisite praise of Lamb, is there any such cunning touch of
tenderness or delicate perfume of pathos as in the parts of
Bellario and Aspatia. These have in them a bitter sweetness,
a subtle pungency of mortal sorrow and tears of divine delight,
beyond the reach of Fletcher. His highest studies of female
character have dignity, energy, devotion of the heroic type;
but they never touch us to the quick, never waken in us any
finer and more profound sense than that of applause and admiration.
There is a modest pathos now and then in his pictures of
feminine submission and slighted or outraged love; but this
submission he is apt to make too servile, this love too dog-like
in its abject devotion to retain that tender reverence which so
many generations of readers have paid to the sweet memories
of Aspatia and Bellario. To excite compassion was enough for
Fletcher as in the masculine parts of his work it was enough for
him to excite wonder, to sustain curiosity, to goad and stimulate
by any vivid and violent means the interest of readers or spectators.
The single instance of noble pathos, the one scene he has
left us which appeals to the higher and purer kind of pity, is the
death of the child Hengo in <i>Bonduca</i>&mdash;a scene which of itself
would have sufficed to enrol his name for ever on the list of our
great tragic poets. To him we may probably assign the whole
merit of that fiery and high-toned tragedy, with all its spirit and
splendour of national and martial passion; the conscious and
demonstrative exchange of courtesy between Roman and Briton,
which is one of the leading notes of the poem, has in it a touch of
overstrained and artificial chivalry characteristic of Fletcher;
yet the parts of Caratach and Poenius may be counted among
the loftiest and most equal of his creations. But no surer test
or better example can be taken of the distinctive quality which
denotes the graver genius of either poet than that supplied by
a comparison of Beaumont&rsquo;s <i>Triumph of Love</i> with Fletcher&rsquo;s
<i>Triumph of Death</i>. Each little play, in the brief course of its
single act, gives proof of the peculiar touch and special trick
of its author&rsquo;s hand: the deeper and more delicate passion of
Beaumont, the rapid and ardent activity of Fletcher, have
nowhere found a more noticeable vent for the expression respectively
of the most tender and profound simplicity of quiet sweetness,
the most buoyant and impatient energy of tragic emotion.</p>

<p>In the wider field of their comic or romantic drama it is yet
easier to distinguish the respective work of either hand. The
bias of Fletcher was towards mixed comedy; his lightest and
wildest humour is usually crossed or tempered by an infusion
of romance; like Shakespeare in this one point at least, he has
left no single play without some touch on it of serious interest,
of poetic eloquence or fancy, however slight and fugitive.
Beaumont, evidently under the imperious influence of Ben
Jonson&rsquo;s more rigid theories, seems rather to have bent his
genius with the whole force of a resolute will into the form or
mould prescribed for comedy by the elder and greater comic poet.
The admirable study of the worthy citizen and his wife, who
introduce to the stage and escort with their applause <i>The Knight
of the Burning Pestle</i> through his adventurous career to its
untimely end, has all the force and fulness of Jonson&rsquo;s humour
at its best, with more of freshness and freedom. In pure comedy,
varied with broad farce and mock-heroic parody, Beaumont was
the earliest as well as the ablest disciple of the master whose
mantle was afterwards to be shared among the academic poets
of a younger generation, the Randolphs and Cartwrights who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page595" id="page595"></a>595</span>
sought shelter under the shadow of its voluminous folds. The
best example of the school of Jonson to be found outside the
ample range of his own work is <i>The Scornful Lady</i>, a comedy
whose exceptional success and prolonged popularity must have
been due rather to the broad effect of its forcible situations, its
wealth and variety of ludicrous incidents, and the strong gross
humour of its dialogue, than to any finer quality of style, invention
or character. It is the only work of Beaumont and Fletcher
which a critic who weighs the meaning of his words can admit
to be as coarse as the coarsest work of Ben Jonson. They are
prone, indeed, to indulge elsewhere in a wanton and exuberant
licence of talk; and Fletcher, at least, is liable to confuse the
shades of right and wrong, to deface or efface the boundary lines
of good and evil, to stain the ermine of virtue and palliate the
nakedness of vice with the same indecorous and incongruous
laxity of handling. Often in mere haste to despatch the business
of a play, to huddle up a catastrophe or throw out some particular
scene into sharp and immediate relief, he will sacrifice all seemliness
and consistency of character to the present aim of stage
effect, and the instant impression of strong incident or audacious
eloquence. His heroines are too apt to utter sentiments worthy
of Diana in language unworthy of Doll Tearsheet. But in this
play both style and sentiment are throughout on a lower level,
the action and emotion are of a baser kind than usual; the
precept of Aristotle and the practice of Jonson have been so
carefully observed and exaggerated that it might almost be said
to offer us in one or two places an imitation not merely of the
sorrier but of the sorriest qualities of human nature; and full
as it is of spontaneous power and humorous invention, the
comedy extolled by the moral Steele (with just so much of
reservation as permits him to deprecate the ridicule cast upon
the clerical character) is certainly more offensive to artistic law
and aesthetic judgment by the general and ingrained coarseness
of its tone, than the tragi-comedy denounced by the immoral
Dryden as exceeding in licence his own worst work and that of
his fellow playwrights; an imputation, be it said in passing, as
groundless as the protest pleaded on their behalf is impudent;
for though we may hardly agree with the uncompromising
panegyrist who commends that play in particular to the approval
of &ldquo;the austere scarlet&rdquo; (remembering, perhaps, that Aristophanes
was the chosen bedfellow of Chrysostom), there is at least no
such offence against art or taste in the eccentricity of its
situations or the daring of its dialogue. The buoyant and
facile grace of Fletcher&rsquo;s style carries him lightly across quagmires
in which a heavier-footed poet, or one of slower tread,
would have stuck fast, and come forth bemired to the knees.
To Beaumont his stars had given as birthright the gifts of tragic
pathos and passion, of tender power and broad strong humour;
to Fletcher had been allotted a more fiery and fruitful force of
invention, a more aerial ease and swiftness of action, a more
various readiness and fulness of bright exuberant speech. The
genius of Beaumont was deeper, sweeter, nobler than his elder&rsquo;s;
the genius of Fletcher more brilliant, more supple, more prodigal,
and more voluble than his friend&rsquo;s. Without a taint or a shadow
on his fame of such imitative servility as marks and degrades
the mere henchman or satellite of a stronger poet, Beaumont
may fairly be said to hold of Shakespeare in his tragedy, in his
comedy of Jonson; in each case rather as a kinsman than as a
client, as an ally than as a follower: but the more special
province of Fletcher was a land of his own discovering, where
no later colonist has ever had power to settle or to share his
reign. With the mixed or romantic comedy of Shakespeare it
has nothing in common except the admixture or alternation of
graver with lighter interest, of serious with humorous action.
Nothing is here of his magic exaltation or charm of fairy empire.
The rare and rash adventures of Fletcher on that forbidden track
are too sure to end in pitiful and shameful failure. His crown
of praise is to have created a wholly new and wholly delightful
form of mixed comedy or dramatic romance, dealing merely
with the humours and sentiments of men, their passions and
their chances; to have woven of all these a web of emotion
and event with such gay dexterity, to have blended his colours
and combined his effects with such exquisite facility and swift
light sureness of touch, that we may return once and again from
those heights and depths of poetry to which access was forbidden
him, ready as ever to enjoy as of old the fresh incomparable
charm, the force and ease and grace of life, which fill and animate
the radiant world of his romantic invention. Neither before
him nor after do we find, in this his special field of fancy and of
work, more than shadows or echoes of his coming or departing
genius. Admirable as are his tragedies already mentioned, rich
in splendid eloquence and strong in large grasp of character as
is the Roman history of <i>The False One</i>, full of interest
and vigour as is the better part of <i>Rollo Duke of Normandy</i>,
and sublime in the loveliness of passion as is the one scene of
perfect beauty and terror which crowns this latter tragedy,
Fletcher may claim a yet higher and more special station among his great dramatic
peers by right of his comic and romantic than by right of his
tragic and historic plays. Even in these he is more a romantic
than a tragic poet. The quality of his genius, never sombre or
subtle or profound, bears him always towards fresh air and
sunshine. His natural work is in a midday world of fearless
boyish laughter and hardly bitter tears. There is always more
of rainbow than of storm in his skies; their darkest shadow is
but a tragic twilight. What with him is the noon of night would
seem as sunshine on the stage of Ford or Webster. There is
but one passage in all these noble plays which lifts us beyond a
sense of the stage, which raises our admiration out of speech
into silence, tempers and transfigures our emotion with a touch
of awe. And this we owe to the genius of Beaumont, exalted
for an instant to the very tone and manner of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
tragedy, when Amintor stands between the dead and the dying
woman whom he has unwittingly slain with hand and tongue.
The first few lines that drop from his stricken lips are probably
the only verses of Beaumont or Fletcher which might pass for
Shakespeare&rsquo;s even with a good judge of style&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;This earth of mine doth tremble,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>But in Fletcher&rsquo;s tragedy, however we may be thrilled and
kindled with high contagious excitement, we are never awed into
dumb delight or dread, never pierced with any sense of terror or
pity too deep or even deep enough for tears. Even his Brunhalts
and Martias can hardly persuade us to forget for the moment
that &ldquo;they do but jest, poison in jest.&rdquo; A critic bitten with the
love of classification might divide those plays of Fletcher usually
ranked together as comedies into three kinds: the first he would
class under the head of pure comedy, the next of heroic or
romantic drama, the third of mixed comedy and romance; in
this, the last and most delightful division of the poet&rsquo;s work the
special qualities of the two former kinds being equally blended
and delicately harmonized. The most perfect and triumphant
examples of this class are <i>The Spanish Curate, Monsieur Thomas,
The Custom of the Country</i>, and <i>The Elder Brother</i>. Next
to these and not too far below them, we may put <i>The Little
French Lawyer</i> (a play which in its broad conception of a
single eccentric humour suggests the collaboration of Beaumont
and the influence of Jonson, but in style and execution throughout
is perfect Fletcher), <i>The Humorous Lieutenant</i> (on which
an almost identical verdict might be passed), <i>Women Pleased,
Beggars&rsquo; Bush</i>, and perhaps we might add <i>The Fair Maid
of the Inn</i>; in most if not in all of which the balance of
exultant and living humour with serious poetic interest of a
noble and various kind is held with even hand and the skill of
a natural master. In pure comedy <i>Rule a Wife and have a Wife</i>
is the acknowledged and consummate masterpiece of Fletcher.
Next to it we might class, for comic spirit and force of character,
<i>Wit without Money, The Wildgoose Chase, The Chances</i>,
and <i>The Noble Gentleman</i>, a broad poetic farce to whose
overflowing fun and masterdom of extravagance no critic has
ever done justice but Leigh Hunt, who has ventured, not without
reason, to match its joyous and preposterous audacities of
superlative and sovereign foolery with the more
sharp-edged satire and practical merriment of <i>King and No
King</i>, where the keen prosaic humour of Bessus and his
swordsmen is as typical of the comic style in which Beaumont
had been trained up under Ben Jonson as the high interest and graduated action of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page596" id="page596"></a>596</span>
serious part of the play are characteristic of his more earnest
genius. Among the purely romantic plays of Fletcher, or those
in which the comic effect is throughout subordinate to the
romantic, <i>The Knight of Malta</i> seems most worthy of the highest
place for the noble beauty and exaltation of spirit which informs
it with a lofty life, for its chivalrous union of heroic passion and
Catholic devotion. This poem is the fairest and the first example
of those sweet fantastic paintings in rose-colour and azure of
visionary chivalry and ideal holiness, by dint of which the
romance of more recent days has sought to cast the glamour of a
mirage over the darkest and deadliest &ldquo;ages of faith.&rdquo; The pure
and fervent eloquence of the style is in perfect keeping with the
high romantic interest of character and story. In the same class
we may rank among the best samples of Fletcher&rsquo;s workmanship
<i>The Pilgrim, The Loyal Subject, A Wife for a Month, Love&rsquo;s
Pilgrimage</i>, and <i>The Lover&rsquo;s Progress</i>,&mdash;rich all of them in
exquisite writing, in varied incident, in brilliant effects and
graceful and passionate interludes. In <i>The Coxcomb</i>, and <i>The
Honest Man&rsquo;s Fortune</i>&mdash;two plays which, on the whole, can
hardly be counted among the best of their class&mdash;there are tones
of homelier emotion, touches of a simpler and more pathetic
interest than usual; and here, as in the two admirable first
scenes between Leucippus and Bacha, which relieve and redeem
from contempt the tragic burlesque of <i>Cupid&rsquo;s Revenge</i>, the note
of Beaumont&rsquo;s manner is at once discernible.</p>

<p>Even the most rapid revision of the work done by these great
twin poets must impress every capable student with a sense of
the homage due to this living witness of their large and liberal
genius. The loss of their names from the roll of English poetry
would be only less than the loss of the few greatest inscribed on
it. Nothing could supply the want of their tragic, their comic or
romantic drama; no larger or more fiery planet can ever arise to
supplant or to eclipse the twin lights of our zodiac. Whatever
their faults of shortcoming or excess, there is in their very names
or the mere thought of their common work a kind of special and
personal attraction for all true lovers of high dramatic poetry.
There is the glory and grace of youth in all they have left us; if
there be also somewhat too much of its graceless as well as its
gracious qualities, yet there hangs about their memory as it were
a music of the morning, a breath and savour of bright early
manhood, a joyous and vigorous air of free life and fruitful
labour, which might charm asleep for ever all thought or blame
of all mortal infirmity or folly, or any stain of earth that may
have soiled in passing the feet of creatures half human and half
divine while yet they dwelt among men. For good or for evil,
they are above all things poets of youth; we cannot conceive of
them grown grey in the dignity of years, venerable with the
authority of long life, and weighted with the wisdom of experience.
In the Olympian circle of the gods and giants of our race who on
earth were their contemporaries and corrivals, they seem to move
among the graver presences and figures of sedater fame like the
two spoilt boys of heaven, lightest of foot and heart and head of
all the brood of deity. Shakespeare may have smiled as Jonson
may have nodded approval of their bright swift work, neither of
these great elders grudging his praise to the special charm which
won for it a preference during one generation at least even over
their own loftier and weightier verse; and indeed the advance in
natural ease, in truth and grace of dialogue, is alike manifest
whether we turn to such of their comic characters as Valentine
and Don John, Rutilio and Monsieur Thomas, from the Truewit
of Jonson or even from the Mercutio of Shakespeare; the one too
stiff with classic starch, the other too full of mere verbal catches
and forced conceits, to persuade us that either can in any age have
fairly represented the light free talk and facile humour of its
youth. In another field than this Beaumont and Fletcher hold as
high and secure a station of their own as any poet of their race.
In perfect workmanship of lyrical jewellery, in perfect bloom and
flower of song-writing, they equal all compeers whom they do not
excel; the blossoms of their growth in this kind may be matched
for colour and fragrance against Shakespeare&rsquo;s, and for morning
freshness and natural purity of form exceed the finest grafts of
Jonson. <i>The Faithful Shepherdess</i> alone might speak for Fletcher
on this score, being as it is simply a lyric poem in semi-dramatic
shape, to be judged only as such, and as such almost faultless;
but in no wise to be classed for praise or blame among the acting
plays of its author, whose one serious error in the matter was the
submission of his Dryad to the critical verdict of an audience too
probably in great part composed of clowns and satyrs far unlike
the loving and sweet-tongued sylvan of his lovely fancy. And
whether we assign to him or to Beaumont the divine song of
melancholy (<i>moestius lacrymis Simonideis</i>), perfect in form as
Catullus and profound in sentiment as Shelley, which Milton
himself could but echo and expand, could not heighten or deepen
its exquisite intensity of thought and word alike, there will
remain witness enough for the younger brother of a lyric power as
pure and rare as his elder&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The excess of influence and popularity over that of other poets
usually ascribed to the work of Beaumont and Fletcher for
some half century or so after their own time has perhaps been
somewhat overstated by tradition. Whatever may have been
for a season the fashion of the stage, it is certain that Shakespeare
can show two editions for one against them in folio; four in all
from 1623 to 1685, while they have but their two of 1647 and
1679. Nor does one see how it can accurately or even plausibly
be said that they were in any exact sense the founders of a school
either in comedy or in tragedy. Massinger, for some years their
survivor, and in some points akin to them as a workman, cannot
properly be counted as their disciple; and no leading poet of
the time had so much in common with them as he. At first
sight, indeed, his choice of romantic subject and treatment of
foreign stories, gathered from the fertile tale-tellers of the south,
and ranging in date from Boccaccio to Cervantes, may seem to
mark him out as a member of the same school; but the deepest
and most distinctive qualities of his genius set it far apart from
theirs; though undoubtedly not so far that any discrepancy or
discord should impair the excellence or injure the keeping of
works in which he took part with Fletcher. Yet, placed beside
theirs, the tone of his thought and speech seems by comparison
severe as well as sober, and sad as well as severe. Their extravagant
and boyish insanity of prostrate royalism is not more
alien from his half pensive and half angry undertone of political
protest than his usually careful and complete structure of story
from their frequently lax and slovenly incoherence of character
or plot, than his well composed and proportioned metre from
their lighter and looser melodies, than the bitter insistence and
elaborate acrimony of his judicial satire on hypocrisy or oppression
from the gaiety or facility of mood which suffers them in
the shifting of a scene to redeem their worst characters by some
juggler&rsquo;s trick of conversion at the last moment allowed them
to wind up a play with universal reconciliation and an act of
oblivion on all hands. They could hardly have drawn with such
steady skill and explicit finish an Overreach or a Luke; but the
strenuous and able work of Massinger at its highest point of
success has no breath in it of their brighter and more immediate
inspiration. Shirley, on the other hand, may certainly be classed
as a pupil who copied their style in water-colour; his best
tragedy and his best comedy, <i>The Traitor</i> and <i>The Lady of
Pleasure</i>, might pass muster undetected among the plays of
Fletcher, and might fairly claim to take rank above the lowest
class of these. In the finest work of Middleton we recognize an
almost exact reproduction of Fletcher&rsquo;s metrical effects,&mdash;a
reverberation of that flowing music, a reiteration of those
feminine final notes. In his later tragi-comedies, throughout
his masterpiece of <i>Women beware Women</i>, and in the noble
scenes which make up the tragic or serious parts of <i>The Changeling</i>
or <i>The Spanish Gipsy</i>,&mdash;wherever, in a word, we find the
admirable but unequal genius of this poet at its best&mdash;we find
a likeness wholly wanting in his earlier and ruder work, which
undoubtedly suggests the influence of Fletcher. Other instances
of imitation, other examples of discipleship, might perhaps be
found among lesser men of the next generation; but the mass
of succeeding playwrights began in a very short time to lower
the style and debase the scheme of dramatic poetry; and
especially to loosen the last ties of harmony, to deface the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page597" id="page597"></a>597</span>
form and feature of tragic verse. In Shirley, the last and least
of those in whom the lineal blood of the old masters was yet
discernible, we find side by side with the fine ancestral indications
of legitimate descent exactly such marks of decadence rather
than degeneracy as we might have anticipated in the latest heir
of a long line which began with the rise of Marlowe, &ldquo;sun of the
morning,&rdquo; in the highest heaven of our song, to prepare a pathway
for the sun. After Shakespeare there was yet room for
Beaumont and Fletcher; but after these and the other constellations
had set, whose lights filled up the measure of that
diviner zodiac through which he moved, there was but room
in heaven for the pallid moonrise of Shirley; and before this
last reflex from a sunken sun was itself eclipsed, the glory had
passed away from English drama, to alight upon that summit of
epic song, whence Milton held communion with darkness and
the stars.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Bibliographical Appendix</p>

<p>The chief collected editions of the plays of Beaumont and
Fletcher are: <i>Comedies and Tragedies written by Francis Beaumont
and John Fletcher Gentlemen</i>, printed by Humphrey
Moseley in folio in 1647 as containing plays &ldquo;never printed
before&rdquo;; <i>Fifty Comedies and Tragedies written, &amp;c.</i> (fol. 1679);
<i>Works ...</i> (11 vols. 1843-1846), edited by Alexander Dyce,
which superseded earlier editions by L. Theobald, G. Colman
and H. Weber, and presented a modernized text; a second
two-volume edition by Dyce in 1852; <i>The Works of Francis
Beaumont and John Fletcher</i> (15 vols. 1905, &amp;c.) edited by Arnold
Glover and A.R. Waller in the &ldquo;Cambridge English Classics&rdquo;
from the text of the 2nd folio, and giving variant readings from
all separate issues of the plays previous to that edition; and
<i>Works ...</i> (12 vols. 1904, &amp;c.), under the general editorship
of A.H. Bullen, the text of which is founded on Dyce but with
many variant readings, the last volume containing memoirs
and excursuses by the editor.</p>

<p>The foundation of all critical work on Beaumont and Fletcher
is to be found in Dyce. Discrimination between the work of the
two dramatists and their collaborators has been the object of a
series of studies for the establishment of metrical and other tests.
Fletcher&rsquo;s verse is recognizable by the frequency of an extra
syllable, often an accented one, at the end of a line, the use of
stopped lines, and the frequency of trisyllabic feet. He thus
obtained an adaptable instrument enabling him to dispense
with prose even in comic scenes. The pioneer work in these
matters was done by F.G. Fleay in a paper read before the New
Shakspere Society in 1874 on &ldquo;Metrical Tests as applied to
Fletcher, Beaumont and Massinger.&rdquo; His theories were further
developed in the article &ldquo;Fletcher&rdquo; in his <i>Biog. Chron. of the
Eng. Drama</i>. Further investigations were published by R. Boyle
in <i>Englische Studien</i> (vols. v.-x., Heilbronn, 1882-1887), and in
the New Shakspere Society <i>Transactions</i> (1880-1886), by Benno
Leonhardt in <i>Anglia</i> (Halle, vols. xix. <i>seq.</i>), and by E.H. Oliphant
in <i>Englische Studien</i> (vols. xiv. <i>seq.</i>). Mr Oliphant restores to
Beaumont much which other critics had been inclined to deny
him. On the sources of the plays see E. Köppel in <i>Münchener
Beiträge zur roman. u. eng. Phil.</i> (Erlangen and Leipzig, 1895).
Consult further articles by A.H. Bullen and R. Boyle respectively
on Fletcher and Massinger in the <i>Dict. of Nat. Biog.</i>; G.C.
Macaulay, <i>Francis Beaumont, a Critical Study</i> (1883); and
Dr A.W. Ward&rsquo;s chapter on &ldquo;Beaumont and Fletcher&rdquo; in
vol. ii. of his <i>Hist. of Eng. Dram. Lit.</i> (new ed. 1899).</p>

<p>A list of the plays attributed to Beaumont and Fletcher, with
some details, is added, with the premiss that beyond the main
lines of criticism laid down in Mr Swinburne&rsquo;s article above it is
often difficult to dogmatize on authorship. Even in cases where
the play was produced long after Beaumont had ceased to write
for the stage there can be no certainty that we are not dealing
with a piece which is an adaptation of an earlier play by a later
hand.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>The Joint Works of Beaumont and Fletcher.&mdash;The Scornful Lady</i>
(acted <i>c.</i> 1609, pr. 1616) is a farcical comedy of domestic life, in
which Oliphant finds traces of alteration by a third and perhaps a
fourth hand. <i>Philaster or Love Lies a-Bleeding</i> is assigned by
Macaulay to Beaumont practically in its entirety, while Fleay
attributes only three scenes to Fletcher. It was probably acted c.
1609, and was printed 1620; it was revised (1695) by Elkanah Settle
and (1763) by the younger Colman, probably owing its long popularity
to the touching character of Bellario. Beaumont&rsquo;s share also
predominated in <i>The Maid&rsquo;s Tragedy</i> (acted <i>c.</i> 1609, pr. 1619), in <i>A
King and No King</i> (acted at court December 26, 1611, and perhaps earlier, pr.
1619), while <i>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</i> (<i>c.</i> 1610, pr.
1613), burlesquing the heroic and romantic play of which Heywood&rsquo;s
<i>Four Prentices</i> is an example, might perhaps be transferred entire to
Beaumont&rsquo;s account. In <i>Cupid&rsquo;s Revenge</i> (acted at court January
1612, and perhaps at Whitefriars in 1610, pr. 1615), founded on
Sidney&rsquo;s <i>Arcadia</i>, the two dramatists appear to have had a third
collaborator in Massinger and perhaps a fourth in Nathaniel Field.</p>

<p>The <i>Coxcomb</i> (acted <i>c.</i> 1610, and by the Children of the Queen&rsquo;s
Revels in 1612, pr. 1647) seems to have undergone later revision by
Massinger. Fletcher&rsquo;s collaboration with other dramatists had
begun during his connexion with Beaumont, who apparently ceased
to write for the stage two or three years before his death.</p>

<p><i>Works Assigned to Beaumont&rsquo;s Sole Authorship.&mdash;The Woman Hater</i>
(pr. 1607, as &ldquo;lately acted by the children of Paul&rsquo;s&rdquo;) was assigned
formerly to Fletcher. The <i>Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray&rsquo;s Inn</i>
was presented at Whitehall on the 26th of February 1612, on the
marriage of the Prince and Princess Palatine. Of <i>Four Plays, or
Moral Representations, in One</i> (acted 1608, pr. 1647), the <i>Induction</i>,
with <i>The Triumph of Honour</i> and <i>The Triumph of Love</i>, both founded
on tales from the <i>Decameron</i>, are by Beaumont.</p>

<p><i>Works Assigned to Fletcher&rsquo;s Sole Authorship.&mdash;The Faithful
Shepherdess</i> (pr. <i>c.</i> 1609) was ill received on its original production,
but was revived in 1634. That Fletcher was the sole author is
practically unquestioned, though Ben Jonson in Drummond&rsquo;s
<i>Conversations</i> is made to assert that &ldquo;Beaumont and Fletcher ten
years since hath written <i>The Faithful Shepherdess</i>.&rdquo; It was translated
into Latin verse by Sir R. Fanshawe in 1658, and Milton&rsquo;s
<i>Comus</i> owes not a little to it. In <i>Four Plays in One</i>, the two last,
<i>The Triumph of Death</i> and <i>The Triumph of Time</i>, are Fletcher&rsquo;s. In
the indifferent comedy of <i>The Captain</i> (acted 1612-1613, revived
1626, pr. 1647) there is no definite evidence of any other hand than
Fletcher&rsquo;s, though the collaboration of Beaumont, Massinger and
Rowley has been advanced. Other Fletcher plays are: <i>Wit Without
Money</i> (acted 1614, pr. 1639); the two romantic tragedies of <i>Bonduca</i>
(in which Caradach or Caractacus is the chief figure rather than
Bonduca or Boadicea) and <i>Valentinian</i>, both dating from <i>c.</i> 1616
and printed in the first folio; <i>The Loyal Subject</i> (acted 1618, revived
at court 1633, pr. 1647); <i>The Mad Lover</i> (acted before March 1619,
pr. 1647), which borrows something from the story of Mundus and
Paulina in Josephus (bk. xviii.); <i>The Humorous Lieutenant</i> (1619,
pr. 1647); <i>Woman Pleased</i> (<i>c.</i> 1620, pr. 1647); <i>The Woman&rsquo;s Prize or
The Tamer Tam&rsquo;d</i> (produced probably between 1610 and 1613, acted
1633 at Blackfriars and at court, pr. 1647), a kind of sequel to <i>The
Taming of the Shrew</i>; <i>The Chances</i> (uncertain date, pr. 1647), taken
from <i>La Sennora Cornelia</i> of Cervantes, and repeatedly revived after
the Restoration and in the 18th century; <i>Monsieur Thomas</i> (acted
perhaps as early as 1609, pr. 1639); <i>The Island Princess</i> (<i>c.</i> 1621, pr.
1647); <i>The Pilgrim</i> and <i>The Wild Goose-Chase</i> (pr. 1652), the second
of which was adapted in prose by Farquhar, both acted at court in
1621, and possibly then not new pieces; <i>A Wife for a Month</i> (acted
1624, pr. 1647); <i>Rule a Wife and Have a Wife</i> (lic. 1624, pr. 1640).
<i>The Pilgrim</i> received additions from Dryden, and was adapted by Vanbrugh.</p>

<p><i>Fletcher in Collaboration with other Dramatists</i>.&mdash;External evidence
of Fletcher&rsquo;s connexion with Massinger is given by Sir Aston Cokaine,
who in an epitaph on Fletcher and Massinger wrote: &ldquo;Playes they did
write together, were great friends,&rdquo; and elsewhere claimed for
Massinger a share in the plays printed in the 1647 folio. James
Shirley and William Rowley have their part in the works that used
to be included in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon; and to a
letter from Field, Daborne and Massinger, asking for £5 for their
joint necessities from Henslowe about the end of 1615, there is
a postscript suggesting the deduction of the sum from the &ldquo;mony
remaynes for the play of Mr Fletcher and ours.&rdquo; The problem is
complicated when the existing versions of the play are posterior to
Fletcher&rsquo;s lifetime, that is, revisions by Massinger or another of
pieces which were even originally of double authorship. In this way
Beaumont&rsquo;s work may be concealed under successive revisions, and
it would be rash to assert that none of the late plays contains anything
of his. Mr R. Boyle joins the name of Cyril Tourneur to those of Fletcher
and Massinger in connexion with <i>The Honest Man&rsquo;s Fortune</i>
(acted 1613, pr. 1647), which Fleay identifies with &ldquo;the play
of Mr Fletcher&rsquo;s and ours.&rdquo; <i>The Knight of Malta</i>
(acted 1618-1619, pr. 1647) is in its existing form a revision by
Fletcher, Massinger, and possibly Field, of an earlier play which
Oliphant thinks was probably written by Beaumont about 1608. The same
remarks (with the exclusion of Field&rsquo;s name) apply to <i>Thierry
and Theodoret</i> (acted <i>c.</i> 1617, pr. 1621), perhaps a satire
on contemporary manners at the French court, though Beaumont&rsquo;s share
in either must be regarded as problematical. Fletcher and Massinger&rsquo;s
great tragedy of <i>Sir John van Olden Barnaveldt</i> (acted 1619) was
first printed in Bullen&rsquo;s
<i>Old Plays</i> (vol. ii., 1883). They followed it up with <i>The Custom of the Country</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page598" id="page598"></a>598</span>
(acted 1619, pr. 1647), based on an English translation
(1619) of <i>Los Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda; The Double Marriage</i>
(<i>c.</i> 1620, pr. 1647); <i>The Little French Lawyer</i> (<i>c.</i> 1620, pr. 1647), the
plot of which can be traced indirectly to a <i>novellino</i> by Massuccio
Salernitano; <i>The Laws of Candy</i> (<i>c.</i> 1618, pr. 1647), of disputed
authorship; <i>The False One</i> (<i>c.</i> 1620, pr. 1647), dealing with the
subject of Caesar and Cleopatra; <i>The Spanish Curate</i> (acted 1622, pr.
1647), repeatedly revived after the Restoration, was derived from
Leonard Digges&rsquo;s translation (1622) of a Spanish novel, <i>Gerardo, the
Unfortunate Spaniard; The Prophetess</i> (1622, pr. 1647), afterwards
made into an opera by Betterton to Purcell&rsquo;s music; <i>The Sea-Voyage</i>
(1622, pr. 1647); <i>The Elder Brother</i> (perhaps originally written by
Fletcher <i>c</i>. 1614; revised and acted 1635, pr. 1647); <i>Beggar&rsquo;s Bush</i>
(acted at court 1622, probably then not new, pr. 1647); and <i>The
Noble Gentleman</i> (1625-1626, pr. 1647). Fletcher only had a small
share in <i>Wit at Several Weapons</i>&mdash;&ldquo;if he but writ an act or two,&rdquo;
says an epilogue on its revival (1623 or 1626),&mdash;and the play is
probably a revision by Rowley and Middleton of an early Beaumont
and Fletcher play. <i>A Very Woman</i> (1634, pr. 1655) is a revision by
Massinger of <i>The Woman&rsquo;s Plot</i> ascribed to Fletcher and acted at
court in 1621. Field worked with Fletcher and Massinger on the
lost play of the <i>Jeweller of Amsterdam</i> (1619), as on the <i>Faithful
Friends</i> (1613-1614) and <i>The Queen of Corinth</i> (<i>c.</i> 1618, pr. 1647).
<i>The Lover&rsquo;s Progress</i> (acted 1634, pr. 1647) is probably a revision by
Massinger of the Fletcher play licensed in 1623 as <i>The Wandering
Lovers</i>, and is perhaps identical with <i>Cleander</i>, licensed in 1634.
<i>Love&rsquo;s Cure or The Martial Maid</i> (1623 or 1625) is thought by Mr
Fleay to be a revision by Massinger of a Beaumont and Fletcher
play produced as early as 1607-1608. W. Rowley joined Fletcher
in <i>The Maid in the Mill</i> (1623, pr. 1647), and had a share with
Massinger in the revision of <i>The Fair Maid of the Inn</i> (licensed 1626,
pr. 1647), based on <i>La illustre Fregona</i> of Cervantes. <i>Nice Valour</i>
(acted 1625-1626, pr. 1647) seems to have been altered by Middleton
from an earlier play; <i>The Widow</i>, printed in 1652 as by Jonson,
Fletcher and Middleton, must be ascribed almost exclusively to
Middleton. <i>The Night Walker</i> (1633) is a revision by Shirley of a
Fletcher play.</p>

<p><i>Fletcher and Jonson in Collaboration</i>.&mdash;The history of <i>The Bloody
Brother or Rollo, Duke of Normandy</i>, printed in 1637 as by &ldquo;B.J.F.,&rdquo;
is matter of varied speculation. Mr Oliphant thinks the basis of the
play to be an early work (<i>c</i>. 1604) of Beaumont, on which is superimposed
a revision (1616) by Fletcher, Jonson and Middleton, and a
subsequent revision (1636-1637) by Massinger. The general view
is that the main portion of the play is referable to Jonson and
Fletcher. Jonson apparently had a share in Fletcher&rsquo;s <i>Love&rsquo;s
Pilgrimage</i> (pr. 1647), which seems to have been revised by Massinger
in 1635.</p>

<p><i>Fletcher and Shakespeare</i>.&mdash;<i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> was printed
in 1634 as by Mr John Fletcher and Mr William Shakespeare. If its
first representation was in 1625 it was in the year of Fletcher&rsquo;s death.
It was included in the second folio of Beaumont and Fletcher&rsquo;s
comedies and tragedies. If Shakespeare and Fletcher worked in
concert it was probably in 1612-1613, and the existing play probably
represents a revision by Massinger in 1625. <i>Henry VIII.</i> (played
at the Globe in 1613) is usually ascribed mainly to Fletcher
and Massinger, and the conditions of its production were probably
similar. Fletcher and Shakespeare are together credited at
Stationers&rsquo; Hall with the lost play of <i>Cardenio</i>, destroyed by
Warburton&rsquo;s cook.</p>

the state, about 28 m. from the Gulf of Mexico and 72 m. N.E.
of Galveston. Pop. (1890) 3296; (1900) 9427, of whom 2953
were negroes; (1910, census) 20,640. It is served by the
Gulf &amp; Interstate, the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fé, the Kansas
City Southern, the Texas &amp; New Orleans, the Colorado Southern,
New Orleans &amp; Pacific, the Beaumont, Sour Lake &amp; Western
(from Beaumont to Sour Lake, Tex.), and the (short) Galveston,
Beaumont &amp; North-Eastern railways. The Neches river from
Beaumont to its mouth has a depth of not less than 19 ft.;
from its mouth extends a canal (9 ft. deep, 100 ft. wide, and 12 m.
long) which connects with the Port Arthur Canal (180 ft. wide
and 25 ft. deep) extending to the sea. Situated in the midst of
a region covered with dense forests of pine and cypress, Beaumont
is one of the largest lumber centres of the southern states;
it is also the centre of a large rice-growing region. The
manufactories include rice mills, saw mills, sash, door and blind
factories, shingle mills, iron works, oil refineries, broom factories
and a dynamite factory. In 1905 the cleaning and polishing of
rice was the most important industry, its output being valued
at $1,203,123, being nearly twice the value of the product of the
rice mills of the city in 1900, 25.9% of the total value of the
state&rsquo;s product of polished and cleaned rice, 46.1% of the value
($2,609,829) of all of Beaumont&rsquo;s factory products, and about
7.4% of the value of the product of polished and cleaned rice
for the whole United States in 1905. After the sinking of oil
wells in 1901, Beaumont became one of the principal oil-producing
places in the United States; its oil refineries are connected
by pipe lines with the surrounding oil fields, and two 6-in. pipe
lines extend from Beaumont to Oklahoma. Beaumont was first
settled in 1828, and was first chartered as a city in 1899.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUNE,<a name="ar211" id="ar211"></a></span> a town of eastern France, capital of an arrondissement
in the department of Côte-d&rsquo;Or, on the Bouzoise, 23 m.
S.S.W. of Dijon on the main line of the Paris-Lyon railway.
Pop. (1906) 11,668. Beaune lies at the foot of the hills of Côte-d&rsquo;Or.
Portions of its ancient fortifications are still to be seen,
but they have been for the most part replaced by a shady
promenade which separates the town from its suburbs. The
most interesting feature of Beaune is the old hospital of St
Esprit, founded in 1443 by Nicolas Rolin, chancellor of Burgundy.
Though it is built largely of wood, the fabric is in good preservation.
The exterior is simple, but the buildings which surround
the main courtyard have high-pitched roofs surmounted by
numerous dormer windows with decorated gables, recalling the
Flemish style of architecture. In the interior there are several
interesting apartments; the chief of these is the ample
council chamber with its fine tapestries, where an important
wine sale is held annually. The hospital possesses many
artistic treasures, among them the mural paintings of the 17th
century in the Salle St Hugues and an altar-piece, the Last
Judgment, attributed to Roger van der Weyden. The principal
church of the town, Notre-Dame, dating mainly from the 12th
and 13th centuries, has a fine central tower and a triple portal
with handsome wooden doors. In the interior there is some
valuable tapestry of the 15th century, and other works of art.
Two round towers (15th century) are a survival of the castle
of Beaune, dismantled by Henry IV. A belfry of 1403 and
several houses of the Renaissance period, some of which are
built over ancient wine-cellars, are architecturally notable.
There is a statue to the mathematician, G. Monge, born in the
town (1746), and a monument to Pierre Joigneaux the politician
(d. 1892). Beaune has tribunals of first instance and of
commerce, a chamber of commerce, a school of agriculture and
viticulture and colleges for girls and boys. It carries on
considerable trade in live-stock and cereals and in the vegetables of
its market-gardens, and manufactures of casks, corks, white
metal, oil, vinegar and machinery for the wine-trade are
included among the industries; it is chiefly important for its
vineyards and as the centre of the wine-trade of Burgundy.</p>

<p>Beaune was a fortified Roman camp and a stronghold during
the middle ages. It was the capital of a separate county which
in 1227 was united to the duchy of Burgundy; it then became
the first seat of the Burgundian parlement or <i>jours généraux</i>
and a ducal residence. On the death of Charles the Bold, it
sided with his daughter, Mary of Burgundy, but was besieged
and taken by the forces of Louis XI. in 1478. Its rank as
commune, conceded to it in 1203, was confirmed by Francis I.
in 1521. In the Wars of Religion it at first sided with the
League, but afterwards opened its gates to the troops of Henry
IV., from whom it received the confirmation of its communal
privileges and permission to demolish its fortifications. The
revocation of the edict of Nantes struck a severe blow at the
cloth and iron industries, which had previously been a source
of prosperity to the town. In the 18th century there were no
fewer than seven monastic buildings in Beaune, besides a Bernardine
abbey, a Carthusian convent and an ecclesiastical college.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUREGARD, MARQUIS DE<a name="ar212" id="ar212"></a></span> (<i>c</i>. 1772-?), French adventurer,
the son of a poor vinegrower named Leuthraud, was born
about 1772. He received the name Beauregard from a nobleman
in whose service he was engaged as valet. On the outbreak of the
revolution, this nobleman converted all his fortune into gold,
and entrusting the bag containing the cash to his valet, fled to
the frontier. For security&rsquo;s sake master and man took different
roads, but Beauregard turned back with the money to Paris.
By speculations in provisions and military equipments under

himself the marquis de Beauregard, purchased a splendid
mansion and began giving magnificent entertainments. Detected
at the height of his success, the impostor was arrested
and condemned to four years in irons and to be branded. He
soon escaped from prison, and had the audacity to reappear in
Paris and start his old life afresh. After a short time, however,
he disappeared again, and is supposed to have committed
suicide. It is probable that most of the information available
about him is a blend of fact and fiction.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUREGARD, PIERRE GUSTAVE TOUTANT<a name="ar213" id="ar213"></a></span> (1818-1893),
American soldier, was born near New Orleans, Louisiana, on the
28th of May 1818. At the United States military academy he
graduated second in his class in July 1838, and was appointed
lieutenant of engineers. In the Mexican War he distinguished
himself in siege operations at Vera Cruz, and took part in all
the battles around Mexico, being wounded at Chapultepec, and
receiving the brevets of captain and major. In 1853 he became
captain and was in charge of fortification and other engineer
works of various points, on the Gulf coast from 1853 to 1860.
He had just been appointed superintendent of West Point when
the secession of his state brought about his resignation (20th
February 1861). As a brigadier-general of the new Confederate
army he directed the bombardment of Fort Sumter, S.C. As
the commander of the Southern &ldquo;Army of the Potomac&rdquo; he
opposed McDowell&rsquo;s advance to Bull Run, and during the battle
was second in command under Joseph E. Johnston, who had
joined him on the previous evening. He was one of the five full
generals appointed in August 1861, and in 1862 was second in
command under Sidney Johnston on the Tennessee. After
Johnston&rsquo;s death he directed the battle of Shiloh, subsequent
to which he retired to Corinth. This place he defended against
the united armies under Halleck, until the end of May 1862,
when he retreated in good order to the southward. His health
now failing, he was employed in less active work. He defended
Charleston against the Union forces from September 1862 to
April 1864. In May 1864 he fought a severe and eventually
successful battle at Drury&rsquo;s Bluff against General Butler and
the Army of the James. Later in the year he endeavoured to
gather troops wherewith to oppose Sherman&rsquo;s advance from
Atlanta, and eventually surrendered with Johnston&rsquo;s forces in
April 1865. After the war he engaged in railway management,
became adjutant-general of his state and managed the Louisiana
lottery. He declined high commands which were offered to him
in the Rumanian and later in the Egyptian armies. General
Beauregard died in New Orleans on the 20th of February 1893.
He was the author of <i>Principles and Maxims of the Art of War</i>
(Charleston, 1863); <i>Report on the Defence of Charleston</i> (Richmond, 1864).</p>

studying theology at the Protestant academy of Saumur, he was
ordained at the age of twenty-two, becoming pastor at
Chatillon-sur-Indre. After the revocation of the edict of Nantes
he fled to Rotterdam (November 1685), and in 1686 was appointed chaplain
to the princess of Dessau, Henrietta Catherine of Orange. In
1693, on the death of the prince of Dessau, he went to Berlin and
became chaplain to the court at Oranienbaum, and in 1695 pastor
of the French church at Berlin. He became court preacher,
counsellor of the Consistory, director of the <i>Maison française</i>,
a hospice for French people, inspector of the French gymnasium and
superintendent of all the French churches in Brandenburg. He died

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEAUVAIS,<a name="ar215" id="ar215"></a></span> a town of northern France, capital of the department
of Oise, 49 m. N. by W. of Paris, on the Northern railway.
Pop. (1906) 17,045. Beauvais lies at the foot of wooded hills on the
left bank of the Thérain at its confluence with the Avelon. Its
ancient ramparts have been destroyed, and it is now surrounded
by boulevards, outside which run branches of the Thérain. In
addition, there are spacious promenades in the north-east of the
town. Its cathedral of St Pierre, in some respects the most
daring achievement of Gothic architecture, consists only of a
transept and choir with apse and seven apse-chapels. The
vaulting in the interior exceeds 150 ft. in height. The small
Romanesque church of the 10th century known as the Basse-Oeuvre
occupies the site destined for the nave. Begun in 1247,
the work was interrupted in 1284 by the collapse of the vaulting
of the choir, in 1573 by the fall of a too ambitious central tower,
after which little addition was made. The transept was built
from 1500 to 1548. Its façades, especially that on the south,
exhibit all the richness of the late Gothic style. The carved
wooden doors of both the north and the south portals are masterpieces
respectively of Gothic and Renaissance workmanship. The church
possesses an elaborate astronomical clock (1866) and
tapestries of the 15th and 17th centuries; but its chief artistic
treasures are stained glass windows of the 13th, 14th and 16th
centuries, the most beautiful of them from the hand of the
Renaissance artist, Engrand Le Prince, a native of Beauvais. To
him also is due some of the stained glass in St. Étienne, the second
church of the town, and an interesting example of the transition
stage between the Romanesque and Gothic styles.</p>

<p>In the Place de l&rsquo;Hôtel de Ville and in the old streets near the
cathedral there are several houses dating from the 12th to the
16th centuries. The hôtel de ville, close to which stands the
statue of Jeanne Hachette (see below), was built in 1752. The
episcopal palace, now used as a court-house, was built in the
16th century, partly upon the Gallo-Roman fortifications. The
industry of Beauvais comprises, besides the state manufacture of
tapestry, which dates from 1664, the manufacture of various
kinds of cotton and woollen goods, brushes, toys, boots and shoes,
and bricks and tiles. Market-gardening flourishes in the vicinity
and an extensive trade is carried on in grain and wine.</p>

<p>The town is the seat of a bishop, a prefect and a court of
assizes; it has tribunals of first instance and of commerce,
together with a chamber of commerce, a branch of the Bank of
France, a higher ecclesiastical seminary, a lycée and training
colleges.</p>

<p>Beauvais was known to the Romans as <i>Caesaromagus</i>, and took
its present name from the Gallic tribe of the Bellovaci, whose
capital it was. In the 9th century it became a countship, which
about 1013 passed to the bishops of Beauvais, who ultimately
became peers of France. In 1346 the town had to defend itself
against the English, who again besieged it in 1433. The siege
which it suffered in 1472 at the hands of the duke of Burgundy
was rendered famous by the heroism of the women, under the
leadership of Jeanne Hachette, whose memory is still celebrated
by a procession on the 14th of October (the feast of Ste Angadrème),
in which the women take precedence of the men.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUVILLIER,<a name="ar216" id="ar216"></a></span> the name of a very ancient French family
belonging to the country around Chartres, members of which are
found filling court offices from the 15th century onward. For
Charles de Beauvillier, gentleman of the chamber to the king,
governor and <i>bailli</i> of Blois, the estate of Saint Aignan was created a countship in 1537. François de Beauvillier, comte de Saint
Aignan, after having been through the campaigns in Germany
(1634-1635), Franche-Comté (1636), and Flanders (1637), was
sent to the Bastille in consequence of his having lost the battle of
Thionville in 1640. In reward for his devotion to the court party
during the Fronde he obtained many signal favours, and Saint
Aignan was raised to a duchy in the peerage of France (duché-pairie)
in 1663. His son Paul, called the duc de Beauvillier, was
several times ambassador to England; he became chief of the
council of finance in 1685, governor of the dukes of Burgundy,
Anjou and Berri from 1689 to 1693, minister of state in 1691, and
grandee of Spain in 1701. He married a daughter of Colbert.
Paul Hippolyte de Beauvillier, comte de Montrésor, afterwards
duc de Saint Aignan, was ambassador at Madrid from 1715 to
1718 and at Rome in 1731, and a member of the council of
regency in 1719.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAUVOIR, ROGER DE,<a name="ar217" id="ar217"></a></span> the <i>nom de plume</i> of <span class="sc">Eugène
Auguste Roger de Bully</span> (1806-1866), French writer, who
was born on the 8th of November 1806 in Paris. He was the son
and nephew of public officials who did not approve his literary
inclinations, and it was at their request that he wrote over the
signature of Roger de Beauvoir. A good-looking young fellow,
of independent means, an indefatigable <i>viveur</i>, he astonished all
Paris with his ostentatious luxury and his adventures, while his
romantic novels gave him a more serious if not durable reputation.
Among the best of them are <i>L&rsquo;Écolier de Cluny ou le Sophisme</i>
(1832), which is said to have furnished Alexandre Dumas and
Theodore Gaillardet (1808-1882) with the idea of the <i>Tour de
Nesle</i>, and <i>Le Chevalier de Saint Georges</i> (1840). He had married
in 1847 an actress, Eléonore Léocadie Doze (1822-1859), from
whom he obtained a judicial separation a year or two later after
a long and notorious trial, following which his mother-in-law got
him imprisoned for three months and fined 500 francs for a
satirical poem, <i>Mon Procès</i> (1849). Ruined by extravagance
and tied to his chair by gout, he spent the last years of his life
in retirement, and died in Paris on the 27th of August 1866.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEAVER,<a name="ar219" id="ar219"></a></span><a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the largest European aquatic representative of the
mammalian order <span class="sc">Rodentia</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), easily recognized by its large
trowel-like, scaly tail, which is expanded in the horizontal
direction. The true beaver (<i>Castor fiber</i>) is a native of Europe
and northern Asia, but it is represented in North America by a
closely-allied species (<i>C. canadensis</i>), chiefly distinguished by
the form of the nasal bones of the skull. Beavers are nearly
allied to the squirrels (<i>Sciuridae</i>), agreeing in certain structural
peculiarities of the lower jaw and skull. In the <i>Sciuridae</i> the
two main bones (tibia and fibula) of the lower half of the leg are
quite separate, the tail is round and hairy, and the habits are
arboreal and terrestrial. In the beavers or <i>Castoridae</i> these
bones are in close contact at their lower ends, the tail is depressed,
expanded and scaly, and the habits are aquatic. Beavers have
webbed hind-feet, and the claw of the second hind-toe double.
In length beavers&mdash;European and American&mdash;measure about
2 ft. exclusive of the tail, which is about 10 in. long. They are
covered with a fur to which they owe their chief commercial
value; this consists of two kinds of hair&mdash;the one close-set,
silky and of a greyish colour, the other much coarser and
longer, and of a reddish brown. Beavers are essentially aquatic
in their habits, never travelling by land unless driven by
necessity. Formerly common in England, the European beaver
has not only been exterminated there, but likewise in most of
the countries of the continent, although a few remain on the
Elbe, the Rhone and in parts of Scandinavia. The American
species is also greatly diminished in numbers from incessant
pursuit for the sake of its valuable fur. Beavers are sociable
anirrals, living in streams, where, so as to render the water of
sufficient depth, they build dams of mud and of the stems and
boughs of trees felled by their powerful incisor teeth. In the
neighbourhood they make their &ldquo;lodges,&rdquo; which are roomy
chambers, with the entrance beneath the water. The mud is
plastered down by the fore-feet, and not, as often supposed, by
the tail, which is employed solely as a rudder. They are mainly
nocturnal, and subsist chiefly on bark and twigs or the roots of
water plants. The dam differs in shape according to the nature
of particular localities. Where the water has little motion it
is almost straight; where the current is considerable it is curved,
with its convexity towards the stream. The materials made use
of are driftwood, green willows, birch and poplars; also mud
and stones intermixed in such a manner as contributes to the
strength of the dam, but there is no particular method observed,
except that the work is carried on with a regular sweep, and that
all the parts are made of equal strength. &ldquo;In places,&rdquo; writes
Hearne, &ldquo;which have been long frequented by beavers undisturbed,
their dams, by frequent repairing, become a solid bank,
capable of resisting a great force both of ice and water; and as
the willow, poplar and birch generally take root and shoot up,
they by degrees form a kind of regular planted hedge, which I
have seen in some places so tall that birds have built their nests
among the branches.&rdquo; Their houses are formed of the same
materials as the dams, with little order or regularity of structure,
and seldom contain more than four old, and six or eight young
beavers. It not unfrequently happens that some of the larger
houses have one or more partitions, but these are only posts of
the main building left by the builders to support the roof, for
the apartments have usually no communication with each other
except by water. The beavers carry the mud and stones with
their fore-paws and the timber between their teeth. They
always work in the night and with great expedition. They
cover their houses late every autumn with fresh mud, which,
freezing when the frost sets in, becomes almost as hard as stone,
so that neither wolves nor wolverines can disturb their repose.</p>

<p>The favourite food of the American beaver is the water-lily
(<i>Nuphar luteum</i>), which bears a resemblance to a cabbage-stalk,
and grows at the bottom of lakes and rivers. Beavers also
gnaw the bark of birch, poplar and willow trees; but during
the summer a more varied herbage, with the addition of berries,
is consumed. When the ice breaks up in spring they always
leave their embankments, and rove about until a little before
the fall of the leaf, when they return to their old habitations,
and lay in their winter stock of wood. They seldom begin to
repair the houses till the frost sets in, and never finish the outer
coating till the cold becomes severe. When they erect a new
habitation they fell the wood early in summer, but seldom begin
building till towards the end of August.</p>

<p>The flesh of the American beaver is eaten by the Indians, and
when roasted in the skin is esteemed a delicacy and is said to
taste like pork. <i>Castoreum</i> is a substance contained in two
pear-shaped pouches situated near the organs of reproduction,
of a bitter taste and slightly foetid odour, at one time largely
employed as a medicine, but now used only in perfumery.</p>

<p>Fossil remains of beavers are found in the peat and other
superficial deposits of England and the continent of Europe;
while in the Pleistocene formations of England and Siberia occur
remains of a giant extinct beaver, <i>Trogontherium cuvieri</i>, representing
a genus by itself.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEBEL, FERDINAND AUGUST<a name="ar224" id="ar224"></a></span> (1840-&emsp;&emsp;), German socialist,
was born at Cologne on the 22nd of February 1840; he became
a turner and worked at Leipzig. Here he took a prominent part
in the workmen&rsquo;s movement and in the association of working
men which had been founded under the influence of Schultz-Delitzsch;
at first an opponent of socialism, he came under the
influence of Liebknecht, and after 1865 he was a confirmed
advocate of socialism. With Liebknecht he belonged to the
branch of the socialists which was in close correspondence with
Karl Marx and the International, and refused to accept the
leadership of Schweitzer, who had attempted to carry on the
work after Lassalle&rsquo;s death. He was one of those who supported
a vote of want of confidence in Schweitzer at the Eisenach
conference in 1867, from which his party was generally known as
&ldquo;the Eisenacher.&rdquo; In this year he was elected a member of the
North German Reichstag for a Saxon constituency, and, with
an interval from 1881 to 1883, remained a member of the German
parliament. His great organizing talent and oratorical power
quickly made him one of the leaders of the socialists and their
chief spokesman in parliament. In 1870 he and Liebknecht
were the only members who did not vote the extraordinary
subsidy required for the war with France; the followers of
Lassalle, on the other hand, voted for the government proposals.
He was the only Socialist who was elected to the Reichstag in
1871, but he used his position to protest against the annexation
of Alsace-Lorraine and to express his full sympathy with the
Paris Commune. Bismarck afterwards said that this speech
of Bebel&rsquo;s was a &ldquo;ray of light,&rdquo; showing him that Socialism was
an enemy to be fought against and crushed; and in 1872 Bebel
was accused in Brunswick of preparation for high treason, and
condemned to two years&rsquo; imprisonment in a fortress, and, for
insulting the German emperor, to nine months&rsquo; ordinary imprisonment.
After his release he helped to organize, at the congress
of Gotha, the united party of Social Democrats, which
had been formed during his imprisonment. After the passing
of the Socialist Law he continued to show great activity in the
debates of the Reichstag, and was also elected a member of the
Saxon parliament; when the state of siege was proclaimed in
Leipzig he was expelled from the city, and in 1886 condemned
to nine months&rsquo; imprisonment for taking part in a secret society.
Although the rules of the Social Democratic party do not recognize
a leader or president, Bebel subsequently became by far
the most influential member of the party. In the party meetings
of 1890 and 1891 his policy was severely attacked, first by the
extremists, the &ldquo;young&rdquo; Socialists from Berlin, who wished
to abandon parliamentary action; against these Bebel won a
complete victory. On the other side he was involved in a
quarrel with Volmar and his school, who desired to put aside
from immediate consideration the complete attainment of the
Socialist ideal, and proposed that the party should aim at bringing
about, not a complete overthrow of society, but a gradual
amelioration. This conflict of tendencies continued, and Bebel
came to be regarded as the chief exponent of the traditional
views of the orthodox Marxist party. He was exposed to some
natural ridicule on the ground that the &ldquo;Kladderadatsch,&rdquo; which
he often spoke of as imminent, failed to make its appearance.
On the other hand, though a strong opponent of militarism, he
publicly stated that foreign nations attacking Germany must not
expect the help or the neutrality of the Social Democrats. His
book, <i>Die Frau und der Socialismus</i> (1893), which went through
many editions and contained an attack on the institution of marriage,
identified him with the most extreme forms of Socialism.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECCAFUMI, DOMENICO DI PACE<a name="ar226" id="ar226"></a></span> (1486-1551), Italian
painter, of the school of Siena. In the early days of the Tuscan
republics Siena had been in artistic genius, and almost in political
importance, the rival of Florence. But after the great plague in
1348 the city declined; and though her population always comprised
an immense number of skilled artists and artificers, yet
her school did not share in the general progress of Italy in the
15th century. About the year 1500, indeed, Siena had no native
artists of the first importance; and her public and private
commissions were often given to natives of other cities. But
after the uncovering of the works of Raphael and Michelangelo
at Rome in 1508, all the schools of Italy were stirred with the
desire of imitating them. Among these accomplished men who
now, without the mind and inspiration of Raphael or Michelangelo,
mastered a great deal of their manner, and initiated the
decadence of Italian art, several of the most accomplished arose
in the school of Siena. Among these was Domenico, the son of a
peasant, one Giacomo di Pace, who worked on the estate of a
well-to-do citizen named Lorenzo Beccafumi. Seeing some signs
of a talent for drawing in his labourer&rsquo;s son, Lorenzo Beccafumi
took the boy into his service and presently adopted him, causing
him to learn painting from masters of the city. Known afterwards
as Domenico Beccafumi, or earlier as Il Mecarino (from
the name of a poor artist with whom he studied), the peasant&rsquo;s
son soon gave proof of extraordinary industry and talent. In
1509 he went to Rome and steeped himself in the manner of the
great men who had just done their first work in the Vatican.
Returning to his native town, Beccafumi quickly gained employment
and a reputation second only to Sodoma. He painted a
vast number both of religious pieces for churches and of mythological
decorations for private patrons. But the work by which
he will longest be remembered is that which he did for the
celebrated pavement of the cathedral of Siena. For a hundred
and fifty years the best artists of the state had been engaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page602" id="page602"></a>602</span>
laying down this pavement with vast designs in <i>commesso</i> work,&mdash;white
marble, that is, engraved with the outlines of the subject in
black, and having borders inlaid with rich patterns in many
colours. From the year 1517 to 1544 Beccafumi was engaged in
continuing this pavement. He made very ingenious improvements
in the technical processes employed, and laid down
multitudinous scenes from the stories of Ahab and Elijah, of
Melchisedec, of Abraham and of Moses. These are not so interesting
as the simpler work of the earlier schools, but are much
more celebrated and more jealously guarded. Such was their
fame that the agents of Charles I. of England, at the time when
he was collecting for Whitehall, went to Siena expressly to try
and purchase the original cartoons. But their owner would not
part with them, and they are now in the Siena Academy and
elsewhere. The subjects have been engraved on wood, by the
hand, as it seems, of Beccafumi himself, who at one time or
another essayed almost every branch of fine art. He made a
triumphal arch and an immense mechanical horse for the procession
of the emperor Charles V. on his entry into Siena. In
his later days, being a solitary liver and continually at work, he
is said to have accelerated his death by over-exertion upon the
processes of bronze-casting.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECCARIA, GIOVANNI BATTISTA<a name="ar227" id="ar227"></a></span> (1716-1781), Italian
physicist, was born at Mondovi on the 3rd of October 1716, and
entered the religious order of the Pious Schools in 1732. He
became professor of experimental physics, first at Palermo and
then at Rome, and was appointed to a similar situation at Turin
in 1748. He was afterwards made tutor to the young princes de
Chablais and de Carignan, and continued to reside principally at
Turin during the remainder of his life. In May 1755 he was
elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, and published
several papers on electrical subjects in the <i>Phil. Trans</i>.
He died at Turin on the 27th of May 1781. Beccaria did much, in the
way both of experiment and exposition, to spread a knowledge
of the electrical researches of Franklin and others. His principal
work was the treatise <i>Dell&rsquo; Elettricismo Naturale ed Artificiale</i>
(1753), which was translated into English in 1776.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECCARIA-BONESANA, CESARE,<a name="ar228" id="ar228"></a></span> <span class="sc">Marchese de</span> (1735-1794),
Italian publicist, was born at Milan on the 15th of March
1735. He was educated in the Jesuit college at Parma, and
showed at first a great aptitude for mathematics. The study
of Montesquieu seems to have directed his attention towards
economic questions; and his first publication (1762) was a
tract on the derangement of the currency in the Milanese states,
with a proposal for its remedy. Shortly after, in conjunction
with his friends the Verris, he formed a literary society, and began
to publish a small journal, in imitation of the <i>Spectator</i>,
called <i>Il Caffè</i>. In 1764 he published his brief but justly
celebrated treatise <i>Dei Delitti e delle Pene</i> (&ldquo;On Crimes and Punishments&rdquo;).
The weighty reasonings of this work were expounded with all the
additional force of a clear and animated style. It pointed out
distinctly and temperately the grounds of the right of punishment,
and from these principles deduced certain propositions as to the
nature and amount of punishment which should be inflicted for
any crime. The book had a surprising success. Within eighteen
months it passed through six editions. It was translated into
French by Morellet in 1766, and published with an anonymous
commentary by Voltaire. An English translation appeared in
1768 and it was translated into several other languages. Many
of the reforms in the penal codes of the principal European
nations are traceable to Beccaria&rsquo;s treatise. In November 1768
he was appointed to the chair of law and economy, which had
been founded expressly for him at the Palatine college of Milan.
His lectures on political economy, which are based on strict
utilitarian principles, are in marked accordance with the theories
of the English school of economists. They are published in the
collection of Italian writers on political economy (<i>Scrittori
Classici Italiani di Economia politico</i>., vols. xi. and xii.).
In 1771 Beccaria was made a member of the supreme economic council;
and in 1791 he was appointed one of the board for the reform of
the judicial code. In this post his labours were of very great
value. He died at Milan on the 28th of November 1794.</p>

Lowestoft parliamentary division of Suffolk, England; on the
right bank of the river Waveney, 109 m. N.E. from London by
the Great Eastern railway. Pop. (1901) 6898. It has a pleasant,
well-wooded site overlooking the flat lands bordering the
Waveney. The church of St Michael, wholly Perpendicular, is a
fine example of the style, having an ornate south porch of two
storeys and a detached bell tower. There are a grammar school
(1712), and boys&rsquo; school and free school on the foundation of Sir
John Leman (1631). Rose Hall, in the vicinity, is a moated
manor of brick, of the 16th century. Printing works, malting,
brick and tile, and agricultural implement works are the chief
industries. Beccles was incorporated in 1584. It is governed by
a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area, 2017 acres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECERRA, GASPAR<a name="ar230" id="ar230"></a></span> (1520-1570), Spanish painter and
sculptor, was born at Baéza in Andalusia. He studied at Rome,
it is said under Michelangelo, and assisted Vasari in painting
the hall of the Concelleria. He also contributed to the anatomical
plates of Valverde. After his return to Spain he was extensively
employed by Philip II., and decorated many of the rooms in
the palace at Madrid with frescoes. He also painted altar-pieces
for several of the churches, most of which have been destroyed.
His fame as a sculptor almost surpassed that as a painter. His
best work was a magnificent figure of the Virgin, which was
destroyed during the French war. He became court painter at
Madrid in 1563, and played a prominent part in the establishment
of the fine arts in Spain.</p>

the shape of the prepared article, but more probably from the
Port, <i>bicho</i>, a worm or grub), or <span class="sc">Trepang</span> (Malay, <i>tripang</i>),
an important food luxury among the Chinese and other Eastern
peoples, connected with the production of which considerable
trade exists in the Eastern Archipelago and the coasts of New
Guinea, and also in California. It consists of several species
of echinoderms, generally referred to the genus <i>Holothuria</i>,
especially <i>H. edulis</i>. The creatures, which exist on coral
reefs, have bodies from 6 to 15 in. long, shaped like a cucumber, hence
their name of &ldquo;sea-cucumbers.&rdquo; The skin is sometimes covered
with spicules or prickles, and sometimes quite smooth, and with
or without &ldquo;teats&rdquo; or ambulacral feet disposed in rows. Five
varieties are recognized in the commerce of the Pacific Islands,
the finest of which is the &ldquo;brown with teats.&rdquo; The large black
come next in value, followed by the small black, the red-bellied
and the white. They are used in the gelatinous soups which form
an important article of food in China. They are prepared for
use by being boiled for about twenty minutes, and then dried
first in the sun and afterwards over a fire, so that they are
slightly smoked.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECHER, JOHANN JOACHIM<a name="ar232" id="ar232"></a></span> (1635-1682), German chemist,
physician, scholar and adventurer, was born at Spires in 1635.
His father, a Lutheran minister, died while he was yet a child,
leaving a widow and three children. The mother married again;
the stepfather spent the tiny patrimony of the children; and
at the age of thirteen Becher found himself responsible not
only for his own support but also for that of his mother and
brothers. He learned and practised several small handicrafts, and
devoting his nights to study of the most miscellaneous description
earned a pittance by teaching. In 1654, at the age of nineteen,
he published an edition of Salzthal&rsquo;s <i>Tractatus de lapide
trismegisto</i>; his <i>Metallurgia</i> followed in 1660; and the
next year appeared his <i>Character pro notitia linguarum universali</i>,
in which he gives 10,000 words for use as a universal language.
In 1663 he published his <i>Oedipum Chemicum</i> and a book on
animals, plants and minerals (<i>Thier- Kräuter- und Bergbuch</i>).
At the same time he was full of schemes, practical and unpractical.
He negotiated with the elector palatine for the establishment
of factories at Mannheim; suggested to the elector of Bavaria
the creation of German colonies in Guiana and the West Indies;
and brought down upon himself the wrath of the Munich
merchants by planning a government monopoly of cloth manufacture
and of trade. He fled from Munich, but found a ready
welcome elsewhere. In 1666 he was appointed teacher of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page603" id="page603"></a>603</span>
medicine at Mainz and body-physician to the archbishop-elector;
and the same year he was made councillor of commerce (<i>Commerzienrat</i>)
at Vienna, where he had gained the powerful support of
Albrecht, Count Zinzendorf, prime minister and grand chamberlain
of the emperor Leopold I. Sent by the emperor on a mission
to Holland, he there wrote in ten days his <i>Methodus Didactica</i>,
which was followed by the <i>Regeln der Christlichen Bundesgenossenschaft</i>
and the <i>Politischer Discurs vom Auj- und Abblühen der
Städte</i>. In 1669 he published his <i>Physica subterranea</i>, and the
same year was engaged with the count of Hanau in a scheme
for settling a large territory between the Orinoco and the Amazon.
Meanwhile he had been appointed physician to the elector of
Bavaria; but in 1670 he was again in Vienna advising on the
establishment of a silk factory and propounding schemes for a
great company to trade with the Low Countries and for a canal
to unite the Rhine and Danube. He then returned to Bavaria,
and his absence bringing him into ill odour at Vienna, he
complained of the incompetence of the council of commerce
and dedicated a tract on trade (<i>Commercien-Tractat</i>) to the
emperor Leopold. His <i>Psychosophia</i> followed, and &ldquo;An invitation
to a psychological community&rdquo; (<i>Einladung zu einer
psychologischen Societät</i>), for the realization of which Duke
Gustavus Adolphus of Mecklenburg-Gustrow (d. 1695) offered
him in 1674 a site in his duchy. The plan came to nothing, and
next year Becher was again busy at Vienna, trying to transmute
Danube sand into gold, and writing his <i>Theses chemicae veritatem
transmutationis metallorum evincentes</i>. For some reason he
incurred the disfavour of Zinzendorf and fled to Holland, where
with the aid of the government he continued his experiments.
Pursued even there by the resentment of his former
patron, he crossed to England, whence he visited the mines of
Scotland at the request of Prince Rupert. He afterwards went
for the same purpose to Cornwall, where he spent a year. At
the beginning of 1680 he presented a paper to the Royal Society,
<i>De nova temporis dimetiendi ratione et accurata horologiorum
constructione</i>, in which he attempted to deprive Huygens of
the honour of applying the pendulum to the measurement of
time. The views of Becher on the composition of substances
mark little essential advance on those of the two preceding
centuries, and the three elements or principles of salt, mercury
and sulphur reappear as the vitrifiable, the mercurial and the
combustible earths. When a substance was burnt he supposed that
the last of these, the <i>terra pinguis</i>, was liberated, and this
conception is the basis on which G.E. Stahl founded his doctrine
of &ldquo;phlogiston.&rdquo; His ideas and experiments on the nature
of minerals and other substances are voluminously set forth in
his <i>Physica Subterranea</i> (Frankfort, 1669); an edition of this,
published at Leipzig in 1703, contains two supplements
(<i>Experimentum chymicum novum</i> and <i>Demonstratio Philosophica</i>),
proving the truth and possibility of transmuting metals, <i>Experimentum
novum ac curiosum de minera arenaria perpetua</i>, the
paper on timepieces already mentioned and also <i>Specimen
Becherianum</i>, a summary of his doctrines by Stahl, who in the
preface acknowledges indebtedness to him in the words <i>Becheriana
sunt quae profero</i>. At Falmouth he wrote his <i>Laboratorium
portabile</i> and at Truro the <i>Alphabetum minerale</i>. In 1682 he
returned to London, where he wrote the <i>Chemischer Glückshafen
oder grosse Concordanz und Collection van 1500 Processen</i> and
died in October of the same year.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BECHUANA,<a name="ar233" id="ar233"></a></span> a South African people, forming a branch of the
great Bantu-Negroid family. They occupy not only Bechuanaland,
to which they have given their name, and Basutoland, but
are the most numerous native race in the Orange River Colony
and in the western and northern districts of the Transvaal. It
seems certain that they reached their present home later than
the Zulu-Xosa [Kaffir] peoples who came down the east coast
of the continent, but it is probable that they started on their
southward journey before the latter. It would appear that the
forerunners of the movement were the Bakalahari and Balala,
who were subsequently reduced to the condition of serfs by the
later arrivals, and who by intermingling to a certain extent with
the aborigines gave rise to the &ldquo;Kalahari Bushmen&rdquo; (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kalahari Desert</a></span>). The Bechuana family may be classed in two
great divisions, the western or Bechuana proper, and the eastern
or Basuto. The Bechuana proper consist of a large number of
tribes, whose early history is extremely confused and involved
owing to continual inter-tribal wars and migrations, during
which many tribes were practically annihilated. Further
confusion was produced by subsequent marauding expeditions
by the coast &ldquo;Kaffirs.&rdquo; An ingenious attempt to disentangle
the highly complicated tribal movements which took place in
the early 19th century may be found in Stow&rsquo;s <i>Native Races
of South Africa</i>. One migration of particular interest calls for
mention. In the early part of the 19th century a number of
Basuto, led by the chief Sebituane, crossed the Zambezi near the
Victoria Falls, and, under the name Makololo, established a
supremacy over the Barotse and neighbouring tribes on the upper
portion of the river, imposing their language on the conquered
peoples. After the death of Sekeletu, Sebituane&rsquo;s successor,
the vassal tribes arose and exterminated their conquerors. Only
a few escaped, whom Sekeletu had sent with David Livingstone
to the coast. These established themselves to the south of Lake
Nyasa, where they are still to be found. Sesuto speech, however,
still prevails in Barotseland. The chief Bechuana tribes were the
Batlapin and Barolong (the last including the Baratlou, Bataung,
Barapulana and Baseleka), together with the great Bakuena or
Bakone people (including the Bahurutsi, Batlaru, Bamangwato,
Batauana, Bangwaketse and Bakuena). The clans representing
the southern Bakuena were in comparatively recent times
welded together to form the Basuto nation, of which the founder
was the chief Moshesh (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Basutoland</a></span>). The Basuto have
been not only influenced in certain cultural details (<i>e.g.</i> the form
of their huts) by the neighbouring Zulu-Xosa [Kaffir] peoples,
but have moreover received an infusion of their blood which
has improved their physique. They are good riders and make
considerable use of their horses in war and the chase.</p>

<p>The Bechuana, though not so tall as Kaffirs, average 5 ft. 6 in.
in stature; they are of slender build and their musculature is
but moderately developed except where a Kaffir strain is found.
Their skin is of a reddish-brown or bronze colour, and their
features are fairly regular, though in all cases coarser than those
of Europeans. One of their chief peculiarities lies in the fact
that each tribe respects (usually) a particular animal, which the
members of the tribe may not eat, and the killing of which, if
necessary, must be accompanied by profuse apologies and
followed by subsequent purification. Many of the tribes take
their name from their <i>siboko</i>, as the animal in question is called;
<i>e.g.</i> the Batlapin, &ldquo;they of the fish&rdquo;; Bakuena, &ldquo;they of the
crocodile.&rdquo; The <i>siboko</i> of the Barolong, who as a tribe are
accomplished smiths, is not an animal but the metal iron; other
tribes have adopted as their particular emblem respectively
the sun, rain, dew, &amp;c. Certain ceremonies are performed in
honour of the tribal emblem, hence an inquiry as to the tribe
of an individual is put in the form &ldquo;What do you dance?&rdquo;
In certain tribes the old and feeble and the sickly children were
killed, and albinos and the deaf and dumb exposed; those born
blind were strangled, and if a mother died in childbirth the
infant was buried alive in the same grave. With the extension
of British authority these practices were prohibited. Circumcision
is universally practised, though there is no fixed age for
it. It is performed at puberty, when the boys are secluded for
a period in the bush. The operation is accompanied by whipping
and even tortures. Girls at puberty must undergo trials of
endurance, <i>e.g.</i> the holding of a bar of heated iron without crying
out. The Bechuana inhabit, for the most part, towns of considerable
size, containing from 5000 to 40,000. Politically they
live under a tribal despotism limited by a council of elders, the
chief seldom exercising his individual authority independently,
though the extent of his power naturally depends on his personality.
They have their public assemblies, but only when circumstances,
chiefly in reference to war, require. These are
generally characterized by great freedom of speech, and there
is no interruption of the speaker. The chief generally closes the
meeting with a long speech, referring to the subjects which each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page604" id="page604"></a>604</span>
speaker has either supported or condemned, not forgetting to
clear his own character of any imputation. These public
assemblies are now, except in Basutoland, of very rare occurrence.
The clothing of the men consists of a leather bandage;
the women wear a skin apron, reaching to the knee, under
which is a fringed girdle. Skin cloaks (<i>kaross</i>) are worn by both
sexes, with the difference that the male garment is distinguished
by a collar. The hair is kept short for the most part; women
shave the head, leaving a tuft on the crown which is plastered
with fat and earth, and adorned with beads. Beads are worn,
and various bracelets of iron, copper and brass.</p>

<p>The Bechuana are mainly an agricultural people, the Bangwaketse
and Bakuena excelling as cultivators. Cattle they
possess, but these are used chiefly for the purpose of purchasing
wives, especially among the Basuto. At the same time they are
excellent craftsmen, and show no little skill in smelting and
working iron and copper and the preparation of hides and
pottery vessels. The most efficient smiths are the Barolong
and Bamangwato (the latter were spared by the Matabele chief
Umsilikazi on this account); the Bangwaketse excel as potters;
the Barolong as wood carvers, and the Bakuena as hut builders.
The huts, with the exception of those of the Basuto who have
adopted the Kaffir model, are cylindrical, with clay-plastered
walls and a conical roof of thatch. In spite of the constant
tribal feuds dating from the beginning of the 19th century, the
Bechuana cannot be classed as a warlike people, especially
when they are compared with the Zulu. Their weapons consist
of the throwing assegai, usually barbed, axes, daggers in carved
sheaths, and, occasionally, bows and arrows, the last sometimes
poisoned. Hide shields of a peculiar shape, resembling a
depressed hour-glass, are found except among the Basuto, who
use a somewhat different pattern. Hunting usually takes the
form of great drives organized in concert, and the game is driven
by means of converging fences to a large pitfall or series of pits.
Their religious beliefs are very vague; they appear to recognize
a somewhat indeterminate spirit of, mainly, evil tendencies,
called <i>Morimo</i>. The plural form of this word, <i>Barimo</i>, is used
of the <i>manes</i> of dead ancestors, to whom a varying amount of
reverence is paid. There is universal belief in charms and
witchcraft, and divination by means of dice is common. Witchdoctors,
who are supposed to counteract evil magic, play a not
insignificant part, and the magician who claims the power of
making rain occupies a very important position, as might be
expected among an agricultural people inhabiting a country
where droughts are not infrequent. They have a great dread
of anything connected with death; when an old man is on the
point of expiring, a net is thrown over him, and he is dragged
from his hut by a hole in the wall, if possible before life is extinct.
The dead are buried in a sitting position with their faces to
the north, in which direction lies their ancestral home. Under
the influence of missionaries, however, large numbers of the
Bechuana have become Christianized, and many of the customs
mentioned are no longer practised.</p>

<p>Polygamy is the rule, but, except in the case of chiefs, is not
found to the same extent as among the Zulu-Xosa [Kaffirs].
The woman is purchased from her father, chiefly by means of
cattle, though among the western Bechuana other articles are
included, many of which become the property of the girl herself.
The wives live in separate huts, and the first is given priority
over those purchased subsequently. Chastity after marriage
is the rule, and adultery and rape are severely punished, as
offences against property. Cannibalism is found, but is rare
and confined to certain tribes.</p>

<p>The Bechuana language, which belongs to the Bantu linguistic
family, is copious, with but few slight dialectic differences,
and is free from the Hottentot elements found in the Kaffir and
Zulu tongues. The richness of the language may be judged
from the fact that, though only oral until reduced to writing by
the missionaries, it has sufficed for the translation of the whole
Bible.</p>

Bechuana, <i>q.v.</i>), a country of British South Africa occupying
the central part of the vast tableland which stretches north to the
Zambezi. It is bounded S. by the Orange river, N.E. and E.
by Matabeleland, the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, and
W. and N. by German South-West Africa. Bechuanaland
geographically and ethnically enjoys almost complete unity, but
politically it is divided as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. British Bechuanaland, since 1895 an integral part of Cape
Colony. Area, 51,424 sq. m. Pop. (1904) 84,210, of whom
9276 were whites.</p>

<p>II. The Bechuanaland Protectorate, the northern part of
the country, governed on the lines of a British crown colony.
Area (estimated), 225,000 sq. m. Pop. (1904) 120,776, of whom
Europeans numbered 1004. The natives, in addition to the
Bechuana tribes, include some thousands of Bushmen (Masarwa).
Administratively attached to the protectorate is the Tati
concession, which covers 2500 sq. m. and forms geographically the
south-west corner of Matabeleland.</p>

<p>The Griqualand West province of Cape Colony belongs also
geographically to Bechuanaland, and except in the Kimberley
diamond mines region is still largely inhabited by Bechuana.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Griqualand</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Physical Features</i>.&mdash;The average height of the tableland of
which Bechuanaland consists is nearly 4000 ft. The surface is
hilly and undulating with a general slope to the west, where the
level falls in considerable areas to little over 2000 ft. A large
part of the country is covered with grass or shrub, chiefly acacia.
There is very little forest land. The western region, the Kalahari
Desert (<i>q.v.</i>), is mainly arid, with a sandy soil, and is covered in
part by dense bush. In the northern region are large marshy
depressions, in which the water is often salt. The best known of
these depressions, Ngami (<i>q.v.</i>), lies to the north-west and is
the central point of an inland water system apparently in process
of drying up. To the north-east and connected with Ngami
by the Botletle river, is the great Makari-Kari salt pan, which
also drains a vast extent of territory, receiving in the rainy
season a large volume of water. The marsh then becomes a
great lake, the water surface stretching beyond the horizon,
while in the dry season a mirage is often seen. The permanent
marsh land covers a region 60 m. from south to north and from
30 to 60 m. east to west. In the south the rivers, such as the
Molopo and the Kuruman, drain towards the Orange. Other
streams are tributaries of the Limpopo, which for some distance
is the frontier between Bechuanaland and the Transvaal.</p>

<p>The rivers of Bechuanaland are, with few exceptions, intermittent
or lose themselves in the desert. It is evident, however,
from the extent of the beds of these streams and of others now
permanently dry, and from remains of ancient forests, that at
a former period the country must have been abundantly watered.
From the many cattle-folds and walls of defence scattered over
the country, and ruins of ancient settlements, it is also evident
that at that period stone-dykes were very common. The increasing
dryness of the land is partly, perhaps largely, attributable
to the cutting down of timber trees both by natives and by
whites, and to the custom of annually burning the grass, which
is destructive to young wood.</p>

<p><i>Climate</i>.&mdash;The climate is healthy and bracing, except in the
lower valleys along the river banks and in the marsh land,
where malarial fever is prevalent. Though in great part within
the tropics, the heat is counteracted by the dryness of the air.
Throughout the year the nights are cool and refreshing; in
winter the cold at night is intense. In the western regions the
rainfall does not exceed 10 in. in the year; in the east the average
rainfall is 26 in. and in places as much as 30 in. The rainy season
is the summer months, November to April, but the rains are
irregular, and, from the causes already indicated, the rainfall
is steadily declining. From December to February violent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page605" id="page605"></a>605</span>
thunder and hail storms are experienced. In the whiter or dry
season there are occasional heavy dust storms.</p>

<p><i>Geology</i>.&mdash;The greater part of Bechuanaland is covered with
superficial deposits consisting of the sands of the desert regions
of the Kalahari and the alluvium and saliferous marls of the
Okavango basin. The oldest rocks, granites, gneisses and
schistose sandstones, the Ngami series, rise to the surface in
the east and south-east and doubtless immediately underlie much
of the sand areas. A sandstone found in the neighbourhood of
Palapye is considered to be the equivalent of the Waterberg
formation of the Transvaal. The Karroo formation and associate
dolerites (<i>Loalemandelstein</i>) occur in the same region. A deposit
of sinter and a calcareous sandstone, known as the Kalahari
Kalk, considered by Dr Passarge to be of Miocene age, overlies
a sandstone and curious breccia (<i>Botletle Schnichten</i>). These
deposits are held by Passarge to indicate Tertiary desert conditions,
to which the basin of the Zambezi is slowly reverting.</p>

<p><i>Fauna</i>.&mdash;Until towards the close of the 19th century Bechuanaland
abounded in big game, and the Kalahari is still the home
of the lion, leopard, hyena, jackal, elephant, hippopotamus,
rhinoceros, buffalo, antelope of many species, ostrich and even
the giraffe. Venomous reptiles, <i>e.g.</i> puff-adders and cobras, are
met with, enormous frogs are common, and walking and flying
locusts, mosquitoes, white ants, flying beetles, scorpions, spiders
and tarantulas are very numerous. The crocodile is found in
some of the rivers. Many of the rivers are well stocked with
fish. In those containing water in the rainy season only, the fish
preserve life when the bed is dry by burrowing deeply in the
ooze before it hardens. The principal fish are the baba or cat-fish
(<i>clarias</i> sp.) and the yellow-fish, both of which attain considerable
size. Bustards (the great kori and the koorhaan) are common.</p>

<p><i>Flora</i>.&mdash;In the eastern district are stretches of grass land, both
sweet and sour veld. In the &ldquo;bush&rdquo; are found tufts of tall
coarse grass with the space between bare or covered with
herbaceous creepers or water-bearing tubers. A common creeper
is one bearing a small scarlet cucumber, and a species of watermelon
called <i>tsoma</i> is also abundant. Of the melon and cucumber
there are both bitter and sweet varieties. Besides the grass and
the creepers the bush is made up of berry-yielding bushes (some
of the bushes being rich in aromatic resinous matter), the wait-a-bit
thorn and white thorned mimosa. The indigo and cotton
plants grow wild. Among the rare big trees&mdash;found chiefly
in the north-east&mdash;are baobab and palmyra and certain fruit
trees, one bearing a pink plum. There are remains of ancient
forests consisting of wild olive trees and the camel thorn, near
which grows the <i>ngotuane</i>, a plant with a profusion of fine,
strongly scented yellow flowers.</p>

<p><i>Chief Towns</i>.&mdash;The chief town in southern Bechuanaland, <i>i.e.</i>
the part incorporated in Cape Colony, is Mafeking (<i>q.v.</i>), near
the headwaters of the Molopo river. It is the headquarters of
the Barolong tribe, and although within the Cape border is the
seat of the administration of the protectorate. Vryburg (pop.,
1904, 2985), founded by Boer filibusters in 1882, and Taungs,
are towns on the railway between Kimberley and Mafeking.
Taungs has some 22,000 inhabitants, being the chief kraal of
the Batlapin tribe. About 7 m. south of Vryburg, at Tiger Kloof,
is an Industrial Training Institute for natives founded in 1904
by the London Missionary Society. Upington (2508) on the north
bank of the Orange, an agricultural centre, is the chief town
in Gordonia, the western division of southern Bechuanaland.
Kuruman (<i>q.v.</i>) is a native town near the source of the Kuruman
river, 85 m. south-west of Vryburg. It has been the scene of
missionary labours since the early years of the 19th century.
North of Mafeking on the railway to Bulawayo are the small
towns of Gaberones and Francistown. The last named is the
chief township in the Tati concession, the centre of a gold-mining
region, and the most important white settlement in the protectorate.
Besides these places there are five or six large native
towns, each the headquarters of a distinct tribe. The most
important is Serowe, with over 20,000 inhabitants, the capital of
the Bamangwato, founded by the chief Khama in 1903. It is
about 250 m. north-north-east of Mafeking, and took the place of
the abandoned capital Palapye, which in its turn had succeeded
Shoshong. The chief centre in the western Kalahari is Lehututu.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture and Trade</i>.&mdash;The soil is very fertile, and if properly
irrigated would yield abundant harvests. Unirrigated land laid
under wheat by the natives is said to yield twelve bushels an
acre. Cereals are grown in many of the river valleys. Maize
and millet are the chief crops. The wealth of the Bechuana
consists principally in their cattle, which they tend with great
care, showing a shrewd discrimination in the choice of pasture
suited to oxen, sheep and goats. Water can usually be obtained
all the year round by sinking wells from 20 to 30 ft. deep. The
&ldquo;sweet veld&rdquo; is specially suitable to cattle, and the finer shorter
grass which succeeds it affords pasturage for sheep.</p>

<p>Gold mines are worked in the Tati district, the first discoveries
having been made there in 1864. There are gold-bearing quartz
reefs at Madibi, near Mafeking, where mining began in 1906.
Diamonds have been found near Vryburg. The existence of coal
near Palapye about 60 ft. below the surface has been proved.
The coal, however, is not mined, and much of the destruction of
timber in southern Bechuanaland was caused by the demand for
fuel for Kimberley. Copper ore has been found near Francistown.</p>

<p>Formerly there was a trade in ostrich feathers and ivory; but
this has ceased, and the chief trade has since consisted in supplying
the natives with European goods in exchange for cattle,
hides, the skins and horns of game, firewood and fencing poles,
and in forwarding goods north and south. The protectorate is a
member of the South African Customs Union. The value of the
goods imported into the protectorate in 1906 was £118,322; the
value of the exports was £77,736. The sale of spirits to natives is
forbidden.</p>

<p><i>Communications</i>.&mdash;As the great highway from Cape Colony to
the north, Bechuanaland has been described as the &ldquo;Suez canal
of South Africa.&rdquo; The trunk railway from Cape Town to the
Victoria Falls traverses the eastern edge of Bechuanaland
throughout its length. The railway enters the country at
Fourteen Streams, 695 m. from Cape Town, and at Ramaquabane,
584 m. farther north, crosses into Rhodesia. The old trade route
to Bulawayo, which skirts the eastern edge of the Kalahari, is
now rarely used. Wagon tracks lead to Ngami, 320 m. N.W.
from Palapye Road Station, and to all the settlements. From
the scarcity of water on the main routes through the Kalahari
these roads are known as &ldquo;the thirsts&rdquo;; along some of them
wells have been sunk by the administration.</p>

<p><i>Government</i>.&mdash;The protectorate is administered by a resident
commissioner, responsible to the high commissioner for South
Africa. Legislation is enacted by proclamations in the name of
the high commissioner. Order is maintained by a small force of
semi-military police recruited in Basutoland and officered by
Europeans. Revenue is obtained mostly from customs and a hut
tax, while the chief items of expenditure have been the police
force and a subsidy of £20,000 per annum towards the cost of the
railway, a liability which terminated in the year 1908. The
average annual revenue for the five years ending the 31st of March
1906 was £30,074; the average annual expenditure during the same
period was £80,114. There is no public debt, the annual deficiency
being made good by a grant-in-aid from the imperial exchequer.
The tribal organization of the Bechuana is maintained, and
native laws and customs, with certain modifications, are upheld.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;Bechuanaland was visited by Europeans towards
the close of the 18th century. The generally peaceful disposition
of the tribes rendered the opening up of the country
comparatively easy. The first regular expedition to
<span class="sidenote">Missionary work.</span>
penetrate far inland was in 1801-1802, when John
(afterwards Sir John) Truter, of the Cape judicial bench, and
William Somerville&mdash;an army physician and afterwards husband
of Mary Somerville&mdash;were sent to the Bechuana tribes to buy
cattle. The London Missionary Society established stations in
what is now Griqualand West in 1803, and in 1818 the station of
Kuruman, in Bechuanaland proper, was founded. In the meantime
M.H.K. Lichtenstein (1804) and W.J. Burchell (1811-1812),
both distinguished naturalists, and other explorers, had made
familiar the general characteristics of the southern part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page606" id="page606"></a>606</span>
country. The Rev. John Campbell, one of the founders of the
Bible Society, also travelled in southern Bechuanaland and the
adjoining districts in 1812-1814 and 1819-1821, adding considerably
to the knowledge of the river systems. About 1817
Mosilikatze, the founder of the Matabele nation, fleeing from the
wrath of Chaka, the Zulu king, began his career of conquest,
during which he ravaged a great part of Bechuanaland and
enrolled large numbers of Bechuana in his armies. Eventually
the Matabele settled to the north-east in the country which
afterwards bore their name. In 1821 Robert Moffat arrived at
Kuruman as agent of the London Missionary Society, and made
it his headquarters for fifty years. Largely as the result of the
work of Moffat (who reduced the Bechuana tongue to writing),
and of other missionaries, the Bechuana advanced notably in
civilization. The arrival of David Livingstone in 1841 marked
the beginning of the systematic exploration of the northern
regions. His travels, and those of C.J. Andersson (1853-1858)
and others, covered almost every part of the country hitherto unknown.
In 1864 Karl Mauch discovered gold in the Tati district.</p>

<p>At the time of the first contact of the Bechuana with white men
the Cape government was the only civilized authority in South
Africa; and from this cause, and the circumstance
that the missionaries who lived among and exercised
<span class="sidenote">Boer encroachment.</span>
great influence over them were of British nationality,
the connexion between Bechuanaland and the Cape
became close. As early as 1836 an act was passed extending the
jurisdiction of the Cape courts in certain cases as far north as 25°
S.&mdash;a limit which included the southern part of Bechuanaland.
Although under strong British influence the country was nevertheless
ruled by its own chiefs, among whom the best-known in
the middle of the 19th century were Montsioa, chief of the
Barolong, and Sechele, chief of the Bakwena and the friend of
Livingstone. At this period the Transvaal Boers were in a very
unsettled state, and those living in the western districts showed
a marked inclination to encroach upon the lands of the Bechuana.
In 1852 Great Britain by the Sand river convention acknowledged
the independence of the Transvaal. Save the Vaal river no
frontier was indicated, and &ldquo;boasting,&rdquo; writes Livingstone in his
<i>Missionary Travels</i>, &ldquo;that the English had given up all the
blacks into their power ... they (the Boers) assaulted the
Bakwains&rdquo; (Bakwena).</p>

<p>With this event the political history of Bechuanaland may be
said to have begun. Not only was Sechele attacked at his
capital Kolobeng, and the European stores and Livingstone&rsquo;s
house there looted, but the Boers stopped a trader named M&lsquo;Cabe
from going northward. Again to quote Livingstone, &ldquo;The
Boers resolved to shut up the interior and I determined to open
the country.&rdquo; In 1858 the Boers told the missionaries that
they must not go north without their (the Boers&rsquo;) consent.
Moffat complained to Sir George Grey, the governor of Cape
Colony, through whose intervention the molestation by Transvaal
Boers of British subjects in their passage through Bechuanaland
was stopped. At a later date (1865) the Boers tried to raise
taxes from the Barolong, but without success, a commando sent
against them in 1868 being driven off by Montsioa&rsquo;s brother
Molema. This led to a protest (in 1870) from Montsioa, which
he lodged with a landdrost at Potchefstroom in the Transvaal,
threatening to submit the matter to the British high commissioner
if any further attempt at taxation were made on the part
of the Boers. The Boers then resorted to cajolery, and at a
meeting held in August 1870, at which President Pretorius and
Paul Kruger represented the Transvaal, invited the Barolong
to join their territories with that of the republic, in order to save
them from becoming British. Montsioa&rsquo;s reply was short: &ldquo;No
one ever spanned-in an ass with an ox in one yoke.&rdquo; In the
following year the claims of the Boers, the Barolong, and other
tribes were submitted to the arbitration of R.W. Keate, lieutenant-governor
of Natal, and his award placed Montsioa&rsquo;s
territory outside the limits of the Transvaal. This attempt of
the Boers to gain possession of Bechuanaland having failed,
T.F. Burgers, the president of the Transvaal in 1872, endeavoured
to replace Montsioa as chief of the Barolong by Moshette, whom
he declared to be the rightful ruler and paramount chief of that
people. The attacks of the Boers at length became so unbearable
that Montsioa in 1874 made a request to the British authorities
to be taken under their protection. In formulating this appeal
he declared that when the Boers were at war with Mosilikatze,
chief of the Matabele, he had aided them on the solemn understanding
that they were to respect his boundaries. This promise
they had broken. Khama, chief of the Bamangwato in northern
Bechuanaland, wrote in August 1876 to Sir Henry Barkly
making an appeal similar to that sent by the Barolong. The
letter contained the following significant passages:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;I write to you, Sir Henry, in order that your queen may
preserve for me my country, it being in her hands. The Boers are
coming into it, and I do not like them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Their actions are cruel
among us black people. We are like money, they sell us and our
children.&rdquo; &ldquo;I ask Her Majesty to defend me, as she defends all her
people. There are three things which distress me very much&mdash;war,
selling people, and drink. All these things I shall find in the
Boers, and it is these things which destroy people to make an end
of them in the country. The custom of the Boers has always been
to cause people to be sold, and to-day they are still selling people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">The statements of Khama in this letter do not appear to have
been exaggerated. The testimony of Livingstone confirms them,
and even a Dutch clergyman, writing in 1869, described the
system of apprenticeship of natives which obtained among the
Boers &ldquo;as slavery in the fullest sense of the word.&rdquo; These
representations on the part of the Barolong, and the Bamangwato
under Khama, supported by the representations of Cape
politicians, led in 1878 to the military occupation of southern
Bechuanaland by a British force under Colonel (afterwards
General Sir Charles) Warren. A small police force continued
to occupy the district until April 1881, but, ignoring the wishes
of the Bechuana and the recommendations of Sir Bartle Frere
(then high commissioner), the home government refused to take
the country under British protection. On the withdrawal of
the police, southern Bechuanaland fell into a state of anarchy,
nor did the fixing (on paper) of the frontier between it and the
Transvaal by the Pretoria convention of August 1881 have any
beneficial effect. There was fighting between Montsioa and
Moshette, while Massow, a Batlapin chief, invited the aid of the
Boers against Mankoroane, who claimed to be paramount chief
of the Batlapin. The Transvaal War of that date offered opportunities
to the freebooting Boers of the west which were not to
be lost. At this time the British, wearied of South African
troubles, were disinclined to respond to native appeals for help.
<span class="sidenote">Stellaland and Goshen.</span>
Consequently the Boers proceeded without let or
hindrance with their conquest and annexation of
territory. In 1882 they set up the republic of Stellaland,
with Vryburg as its capital, and forthwith
proceeded to set up the republic of Goshen, farther north, in
spite of the protests of Montsioa, and established a small town
called Rooi Grond as capital. They then summoned Montsioa
to quit the territory. The efforts of the British authorities at
this period (1882-1883) to bring about a satisfactory settlement
were feeble and futile, and fighting continued until peace was
made entirely on Boer lines. The Transvaal government was
to have supreme power, and to be the final arbiter in case of
future quarrels arising among the native chiefs. This agreement,
arrived at without any reference to the British government, was
a breach of the Pretoria convention, and led to an intimation on
the part of Great Britain that she could not recognize the new
republics. In South Africa, as well as in England, strong feeling
was aroused by this act of aggression. Unless steps were taken
at once, the whole of Bechuanaland might be permanently lost,
while German territory on the west might readily be extended
to join with that of the Boers. In the London convention of
February 1884, conceded by Lord Derby in response to the
overtures of Boer delegates, the Transvaal boundaries were
again defined, part of eastern Bechuanaland being included in
Boer territory. In spite of the convention the Boers remained
in Stellaland and Goshen&mdash;which were west of the new Transvaal
frontier, and in April 1884 the Rev. John Mackenzie, who had
succeeded Livingstone, was sent to the country to arrange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page607" id="page607"></a>607</span>
matters. He found very little difficulty in negotiating with the
various Bechuana chiefs, but with the Boers he was not so
successful. In Goshen the Boers defied his authority, while
in Stellaland only a half-hearted acceptance of it was given.
At the instance of the new Cape government, formed in May
and under control of the Afrikander Bond, Mackenzie, who was
accused of being too &ldquo;pro-Bechuana&rdquo; and who had been refused
the help of any armed force, was recalled on the 30th of July by
the high commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson. In his place
Cecil Rhodes, then leader of the Opposition in the Cape parliament,
was sent to Bechuanaland.</p>

<p>Rhodes&rsquo;s mission was attended with great difficulty. British
prestige after the disastrous Boer War of 1881 was at a very low
ebb, and he realized that he could not count on any
active help from the imperial or colonial authorities.
<span class="sidenote">Rhodes&rsquo;s Mission.</span>
He adopted a tone of conciliation, and decided that
the Stellaland republic should remain under a sort of British
suzerainty. But in Goshen the Boers would let him do nothing.
Commandant P.J. Joubert, after meeting him at Rooi Grond,
entered the country and attacked Montsioa. Rhodes then left
under protest, declaring that the Boers were making war against
Great Britain. The Boers now (10th of September) proclaimed
the country under Transvaal protection. This was a breach of
the London convention, and President Kruger explained that
the steps had been taken in the &ldquo;interests of humanity.&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">Warren expedition.</span>
Indignant protest in Cape Town and throughout
South Africa, as well as England, led to the despatch
in October 1884 of the Warren expedition, which was
sent out by the British government to remove the filibusters, to
bring about peace in the country, and to hold it until further
measures were decided upon. Before Sir Charles Warren
reached Africa, Sir Thomas Upington, the Cape premier, and
Sir Gordon Sprigg, the treasurer-general, went to Bechuanaland
and arranged a &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; which would have left the Boer
filibusters in possession, but the imperial government refused
to take notice of this &ldquo;settlement.&rdquo; Public opinion throughout
Great Britain was too strong to be ignored. The limit of concessions
to the Boers had been reached, and Sir Charles Warren&rsquo;s
force&mdash;4000 strong&mdash;had reached the Vaal river in January 1885.
On the 22nd of January Kruger met Warren at the Modder
river, and endeavoured to stop him from proceeding farther,
saying that he would be responsible for keeping order in the
country. Warren, however, continued his march, and without
firing a shot broke up the republics of Stellaland and Goshen.
Bechuanaland was formally taken under British protection
(30th of September 1885), and the sphere of British influence
was declared to extend N. to 22° S. and W. to 20° E. (which last-mentioned
line marks the eastern limit of German South-West Africa).</p>

<p>The natives cheerfully accepted this new departure in British
policy, and from this time forward Khama&rsquo;s country was known
as the British protectorate of Bechuanaland. That portion
lying to the south of the Molopo river was described as British
Bechuanaland, and was constituted a crown colony. In 1891
<span class="sidenote">British protectorate.</span>
the northern frontier of the protectorate was extended
to its present boundaries, and the whole of it placed
under the administration of a resident commissioner,
a protest being made at the time by the British South
Africa Company on the ground that the protectorate was
included in the sphere of their charter. Under the able administration
(1885-1895) of Sir Sidney Shippard (<i>q.v</i>.) peace was
maintained among the natives, who have shown great loyalty
to British rule.</p>

<p>The history of the country shows how much has been due to
the efforts of men like Livingstone, Mackenzie and Rhodes. It
is quite clear that had they not represented the true state of
affairs to the authorities the whole of this territory would have
gradually been absorbed by the Boers, until they had effected a
union with the Germans on the west. The great road to the
north would thus have been effectually shut against trade and
British colonization. With regard to the precise effect of
missionary influence upon the natives, opinion will always
remain divided. But Livingstone, who was not only a missionary
but also an enlightened traveller, stated that a considerable
amount of benefit had been conferred upon the native
races by missionary teaching. Livingstone was a great advocate
of the prohibition of alcohol among the natives, and that policy
was always adhered to by Khama.</p>

<p>In 1891 the South African Customs Union was extended to
British Bechuanaland, and in 1895 the country was annexed to
Cape Colony. At the same time it was provisionally arranged
that the Bechuanaland protectorate should pass under the
administration of the British South Africa Company (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rhodesia</a></span>).
Khama and two other Bechuana chiefs came to
England and protested against this arrangement. The result was
that their territories and those of other petty chiefs lying to the
north of the Molopo were made native reserves, into which the
importation of alcohol was forbidden. A British resident officer
was to be appointed to each of the reserves. A stipulation,
however, was made with these chiefs that a strip of country
sufficient for the purposes of a railway to Matabeleland should be
conceded to the Chartered Company. In December 1895 the
occurrence of the Jameson Raid, which started from these
territories, prevented the completion of negotiations, and the
administration of the protectorate remained in the hands of the
imperial government. The administration, besides fostering the
scanty material resources of the country, aids the missionaries in
their endeavours to raise the Bechuanas in the scale of civilization.
The results are full of encouragement. The natives proved
staunch to the British connexion during the war of 1899-1902,
and Khama and other chiefs gave help by providing transport.
Anxiety was caused on the western frontier during the German
campaigns against the Hottentots and Herero (1903-1908), many
natives seeking refuge in the protectorate. A dispute concerning
the chieftainship of the Batawana in the Ngami district threatened
trouble in 1906, but was brought to a peaceful issue. The
Bechuana were entirely unaffected by the Kaffir rebellion in
Natal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECK, CHRISTIAN DANIEL<a name="ar235" id="ar235"></a></span> (1757-1832), German philologist,
historian, theologian and antiquarian, one of the most learned
men of his time, was born at Leipzig on the 22nd of January
1757. He studied at Leipzig University, where he was appointed
(1785) professor of Greek and Latin literature. This post he
resigned in 1819 in order to take up the professorship of history,
but resumed it in 1825. He also had the management of the
university library, was director of the institute for the deaf and
dumb, and filled many educational and municipal offices. In
1784 he founded a philological society, which grew into a philological seminary, superintended by him until his death. In 1808
he was made a <i>Hofrath</i> by the king of Saxony, and in 1820 a
knight of the civil order of merit. His philological lectures, in
which grammar and criticism were subordinated to history, were
largely attended by hearers from all parts of Germany. He died
at Leipzig on the 13th of December 1832. He edited a number
of classical authors: <i>Pedo Albinovanus</i> (1783), Pindar and the
Scholia (1792-1795), Aristophanes (with others, 1794, &amp;c.),

Euripides (1778-1788), Apollonius Rhodius (1797), Demosthenes
<i>De Pace</i> (1799), Plato (1813-1819), Cicero (1795-1807), Titus
Calpurnius Siculus (1803). He translated Ferguson&rsquo;s <i>Fall of the
Roman Republic</i> and Goldsmith&rsquo;s <i>History of Greece</i>, and added
two volumes to Bauer&rsquo;s Thucydides. He also wrote on theological
and historical subjects, and edited philological and
bibliographical journals. He possessed a large and valuable

was born at Arnheim in Guelderland. He was trained by Van Dyck,
from whom he acquired the fine manner of pencilling and
sweet style of colouring peculiar to that great master. He
possessed likewise that freedom of hand and readiness, or rather
rapidity of execution, for which Van Dyck was so remarkable,
insomuch that when King Charles I. observed the expeditious
manner of Beck&rsquo;s painting, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Faith! Beck, I believe
you could paint riding post.&rdquo; He was appointed portrait-painter
and chamberlain to Queen Christina of Sweden, and he executed
portraits of most of the sovereigns of Europe to adorn her gallery.
His death at the Hague was suspected of being due to poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECK, JAKOB SIGISMUND<a name="ar237" id="ar237"></a></span> (1761-1840), German philosopher,
was born at Danzig in 1761. Educated at Königsberg, he became
professor of philosophy first at Halle (1791-1799) and then
at Rostock. He devoted himself to criticism and explanation
of the doctrine of Kant, and in 1793 published the <i>Erläuternder
Auszug aus Kants kritischen Schriften</i>, which has been widely
used as a compendium of Kantian doctrine. He endeavoured to
explain away certain of the contradictions which are found in
Kant&rsquo;s system by saying that much of the language is used in
a popular sense for the sake of intelligibility, <i>e.g.</i> where Kant
attributes to things-in-themselves an existence under the
conditions of time, space and causality, and yet holds that they
furnish the material of our apprehensions. Beck maintains that
the real meaning of Kant&rsquo;s theory is idealism; that of objects
outside the domain of consciousness, knowledge is impossible,
and hence that nothing positive remains when we have removed the
subjective element. Matter is deduced by the &ldquo;original synthesis.&rdquo;
Similarly, the idea of God is a symbolical representation
of the voice of conscience guiding from within. The value of
Beck&rsquo;s exegesis has been to a great extent overlooked owing to
the greater attention given to the work of Fichte. Beside the
three volumes of the <i>Erläuternder Auszug</i>, he published the
<i>Grundriss der krit. Philosophie</i> (1796), containing an interpretation
of the Kantian <i>Kritik</i> in the manner of Salomon Maimon.</p>

from the western tower of the Crystal Palace almost to the south
end of Bromley, and contains the residential suburb of Shortlands.
Its rapid increase in size in the last decade of the 19th
century was owing to the popularity which it attained as a place
of residence for London business men. It retains, however,
some of its rural character, and has wide thoroughfares and
many handsome residences standing in extensive grounds.
King William IV.&rsquo;s Naval Asylum was endowed by Queen Adelaide
for 12 widows of naval officers. The church of St George was built
in 1866 on the site of an ancient Perpendicular church.
Some 16th-century brasses, an altar tomb and a piscina were
removed hither from the old church. The tower of the church was
completed in 1903, and furnished with two bells in memory of
Cecil Rhodes, in addition to the old bells, one of which dates from 1624.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECKER, HEINRICH<a name="ar239" id="ar239"></a></span> (1770-1822), German actor, whose
real name was <span class="sc">Blumenthal</span>, was born at Berlin. He obtained,
while quite a young man, an appointment in the court theatre
at Weimar, at that time under Goethe&rsquo;s auspices. The poet
recognized his talent, appointed him stage-manager, entrusted
him with several of the leading roles in his dramas and consulted
him in all matters connected with the staging of his plays.
For many years Becker was the favourite of the Weimar stage,
and although he was at his best in comedy, he played, to Goethe&rsquo;s
great satisfaction, Vansen in <i>Egmont</i>, and was also seen to great
advantage in the leading parts of several of Schiller&rsquo;s plays;
notably Burleigh in <i>Maria Stuart</i>, Karl Moor in <i>Die Räuber</i>,
and Antonio in <i>Torquato Tasso</i>. Becker left Weimar in the
spring of 1809, played for a short time at Hamburg (under
Schröder) and at Breslau, and then began a wandering life,
now joining travelling companies, now playing at provincial
theatres. Broken in health and ruined in fortune he returned
in 1820 to Weimar, where he was again cordially received by
Goethe, who reinstated him at the theatre. After playing for two
short years with indifferent success, he died at Weimar in 1822.</p>

<p>Becker was twice married. His first wife, <span class="sc">Christiane Luise
Amalie Becker</span> (1778-1797), was the daughter of a theatrical
manager and dramatic poet, Johann Christian Neumann, and
made her first stage appearance in 1787 at Weimar. Here she
received some training from Goethe and from Corona Schröter,
the singer, and her beauty and charm made her the favourite
both of court and public. She married Heinrich Becker in 1793.
She died on the 22nd of September 1797. Her last part was that
of Euphrosyne in the opera <i>Das Petermännchen</i>, and it is under
this name that Goethe immortalized her in a poem which first
appeared in Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Musen Almanack</i> of 1799.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BECKER, WILHELM ADOLF<a name="ar240" id="ar240"></a></span> (1796-1846), German classical
archaeologist, was born at Dresden. At first destined for a
commercial life, he was in 1812 sent to the celebrated school at
Pforta. In 1816 he entered the university of Leipzig, where he
studied under Beck and Hermann. After holding subordinate
posts at Zerbst and Meissen, he was in 1842 appointed professor
of archaeology at Leipzig. He died at Meissen on the 30th of
September 1846. The works by which Becker is most widely known
are the <i>Gallus</i> or <i>Römische Scenen aus der Zeit Augusts</i>
(1838, new ed. by Göll, 1880-1882), and the <i>Charicles</i> or
<i>Bilder altgriechischer Sitte</i>, (1840, new ed. by Göll, 1877-1878).
These two books, which have been translated into English by Frederick
Metcalfe, contain a very interesting description of the everyday
life of the ancient Greeks and Romans, in the form of a romance.
The notes and appendixes are valuable. More important is the
great <i>Handbuch der röm. Alterthümer</i> (1843-1868), completed
after Becker&rsquo;s death by Marquardt and Mommsen. Becker&rsquo;s treatises
<i>De Comicis Romanorum Fabulis</i> (1837),

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BECKET, THOMAS<a name="ar241" id="ar241"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1118-1170), by his contemporaries
more commonly called Thomas of London, English chancellor
and archbishop of Canterbury under Henry II., was born about
the year 1118 in London. His mother was a native of Caen;
his father, who came of a family of small Norman landowners,
had been a citizen of Rouen, but migrated to London before the
birth of Thomas, and held at one time the dignified office of
portreeve, although he ended his life in straitened circumstances.
The young Thomas received an excellent education. At the
age of ten he was put to school with the canons of Merton priory
in Surrey. Later he spent some time in the schools of London,
which enjoyed at that time a high reputation, and finally studied
theology at Paris. Returning at the age of twenty-two he was
compelled, through the misfortunes of his parents, to become
a notary in the service of a wealthy kinsman, Osbert Huit Deniers,
who was of some importance in London politics. About 1142
a family friend brought Thomas under the notice of Archbishop
Theobald, of whose household he at once became an inmate.
He accompanied the primate to Rome in 1143, and also to the
council of Reims (1148), which Theobald attended in defiance of
a prohibition from the king. It appears to have been at some
time between the dates of these two journeys that he visited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page609" id="page609"></a>609</span>
Bologna and Auxerre, and began those studies in the canon law
to which he was in no small degree indebted for his subsequent
advancement and misfortunes. Although the bent of his mind
was legal, he never made himself an expert jurist; but he had
the art of turning his knowledge, such as it was, to excellent
account. In 1151 he was sent to Rome by the archbishop with
instructions to dissuade the Curia from sanctioning the coronation
of Stephen&rsquo;s eldest son Eustace. It is said that Thomas
distinguished himself by the ability with which he executed his
commission; in any case it gave him a claim on the gratitude of
the Angevin party which was not forgotten. In 1154 he was
promoted to be archdeacon of Canterbury, after first taking
deacon&rsquo;s orders. In the following year Henry II., at the primate&rsquo;s
recommendation, bestowed on him the important office of
chancellor. In this capacity Thomas controlled the issue of
royal writs and the distribution of ecclesiastical patronage;
but it was more important for his future that he had ample
opportunities of exercising his personal fascination upon a prince
who was comparatively inexperienced, and thirteen or fourteen
years his junior. He became Henry&rsquo;s bosom friend and was consulted
in all affairs of state. It had been the hope of Theobald
that Becket&rsquo;s influence would be exercised to support the
extensive privileges which the Church had wrested from Stephen.
But the chancellor, although preserving friendly relations with
his old patron, subordinated the interests of the Church to those
of his new master. Under his administration the Church was
severely taxed for the prosecution of Henry&rsquo;s foreign wars;
and the chancellor incurred the reproach &ldquo;of plunging his sword
into the bowels of his mother.&rdquo; Like Wolsey he identified
himself with the military aspirations of his sovereign. It was
Thomas who organized the Toulouse campaign of 1159; even
in the field he made himself conspicuous by commanding a
company of knights, directing the work of devastation, and
superintending the conduct of the war after the king had
withdrawn his presence from the camp. When there was war with
France upon the Norman border, the chancellor acted as Henry&rsquo;s
representative; and on one occasion engaged in single combat
and unhorsed a French knight of reputation. Later it fell to
his part to arrange the terms of peace with France. He
discharged the duties of an envoy with equal magnificence and
dexterity; the treaty of May 1160, which put an end to the war,
was of his making.</p>

<p>In 1162 he was transferred to a new sphere of action. Henry
bestowed on him the see of Canterbury, left vacant by the
death of Theobald. The appointment caused some murmurs;
since Becket, at the time when it was made, was still a simple
deacon. But it had been desired by Theobald as the one means
of averting an attack on clerical privileges which had been
impending almost since the accession of Henry II.; and the
bishops accepted it in silence. Henry on his side looked to find
in Becket the archbishop a coadjutor as loyal as Becket the
archdeacon; and anticipated that the Church would once more
be reduced to that state of dependence in which she had stood
during the latter years of Henry I. Becket, however, disappointed
all the conflicting expectations excited by his appointment.
He did not allow himself to be made the king&rsquo;s tool; nor on the
other hand did he attempt to protect the Church by humouring
the king in ordinary matters. He devoted himself to ascetic
practices, confined himself to the society of churchmen, and
resigned the chancellorship in spite of a papal dispensation
(procured by the king) which authorized him to hold that office
concurrently with the primacy. By nature a violent partisan,
the archbishop now showed himself the uncompromising champion
of his order and his see. Hence he was on the worst of terms
with the king before a year had elapsed. They came
into open conflict at the council of Woodstock (July 1163), when
Becket successfully opposed the king&rsquo;s proposal that a land-tax,
known as the sheriff&rsquo;s aid, which formed part of that official&rsquo;s
salary, should be henceforth paid into the Exchequer. But
there were more serious differences in the background. Becket
had not shrunk from excommunicating a tenant in chief who
had encroached upon the lands of Canterbury, and had protected
against the royal courts a clerk named Philip de Brois who was
charged with an assault upon a royal officer. These disputes
involved questions of principle which had long occupied
Henry&rsquo;s attention, and Becket&rsquo;s defiant attitude was answered
by the famous Constitutions of Clarendon (<i>q.v.</i>), in which the
king defined, professedly according to ancient use and custom,
the relations of Church and State. Becket and the bishops were
required to give these constitutions their approval. Henry&rsquo;s
demands were more defensible in substance than might be
supposed from the manner in which he pressed them on the
bishops. On the most burning question, that of criminous
clerks, he offered a compromise. He was willing that the accused
should be tried in the courts Christian provided that the punishment
of the guilty were left to the lay power. Becket&rsquo;s opposition
rested upon a casuistic interpretation of the canon law,
and an extravagant conception of the dignity attaching to the
priesthood; he showed, moreover, a disposition to quibble, to
equivocate, and to make promises which he had no intention
of fulfilling. His conduct may be excused on the ground that
the bishops were subjected to unwarrantable intimidation. But
when he renounced his promise to observe the constitutions his
conduct was reprobated by the other bishops, although approved
by the pope. It was fortunate for Becket&rsquo;s reputation that
Henry punished him for his change of front by a systematic
persecution in the forms of law. The archbishop was thus
enabled to invoke the pope&rsquo;s assistance, and to quit the country
with some show of dignity.</p>

<p>Becket fled to France in November 1164. He at once succeeded
in obtaining from Alexander III. a formal condemnation
of the constitutions. But Alexander, a fugitive from Italy and
menaced by an alliance of the emperor with an antipope, was
indisposed to take extreme measures against Henry; and six
years elapsed before the king found himself definitely confronted
with the choice between an interdict and a surrender. For the
greater part of this time the archbishop resided at the Burgundian
monastery of Pontigny, constantly engaged in negotiations with
Alexander, whose hand he desired to force, and with Henry, from
whom he hoped to extract an unconditional submission. In
1166 Becket received from the pope a commission to publish
what censures he thought fit; of which he at once availed himself
to excommunicate the king&rsquo;s principal counsellors. In 1169 he
took the same step against two of the royalist bishops. In
more sweeping measures, however, the pope refused to support
him, until in 1170 Henry infringed the rights of Canterbury
by causing Archbishop Roger of York to crown the young king.
In that year the threats of the pope forced Henry to a reconciliation
which took place later at Fréteval on the 22nd of July.
It was a hollow truce, since the subject of the constitutions was
not mentioned; and Thomas returned to England with the
determination of riding roughshod over the king&rsquo;s supporters.
If he had not given a definite pledge to forgive the bishops who
had taken part in the young king&rsquo;s coronation, he had at least
raised expectations that he would overlook all past offences.
But the archbishop prevailed upon the pope to suspend the
bishops, and before his return published papal letters which,
in announcing these sentences, spoke of the constitutions as null
and void. It was only to be expected that such a step, which
was virtually a declaration of war against the king, should arouse
in him the strongest feelings of resentment. The archbishop&rsquo;s
murder, perpetrated within a month of his return to England
(29th December 1170), was, however, the work of over zealous
courtiers and regretted by no one more than Henry.</p>

<p>Becket was canonized in 1172. Within a short time his shrine
at Canterbury became the resort of innumerable pilgrims.
Plenary indulgences were given for a visit to the shrine, and an
official register was kept to record the miracles wrought by the
relics of the saint. The shrine was magnificently adorned with
the gold and silver and jewels offered by the pious. It was
plundered by Henry VIII., to whom the memory of Becket was
specially obnoxious; but the reformers were powerless to
expunge the name of the saint from the Roman calendar, on
which it still remains. Even to those who are in sympathy with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page610" id="page610"></a>610</span>
the principles for which he fought, the posthumous reputation
of Becket must appear strangely exaggerated. It is evident
that in the course of his long struggle with the state he fell more
and more under the dominion of personal motives. At the last
he fought not so much for an idea as for the humiliation of an
opponent by whom he had been ungenerously treated. William
of Newburgh appears to express the verdict of the most impartial
contemporaries when he says that the bishop was <i>zelo justitiae
fervidus, utrum autem plene secundum scientiam novit Deus</i>:
&ldquo;burning with zeal for justice, but whether altogether according
to wisdom God knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECKFORD, WILLIAM<a name="ar242" id="ar242"></a></span> (1760-1844), English author, son of
Alderman William Beckford (1709-1770), was born on the 1st
of October 1760. His father was lord mayor of London in
1762 and again in 1769; he was a famous supporter of John
Wilkes, and on his monument in the Guildhall were afterwards
inscribed the words of his manly and outspoken reproof to
George III. on the occasion of the City of London address to
the king in 1770. At the age of eleven young Beckford inherited
a princely fortune from his father. He married Lady Margaret
Gordon in 1783, and spent his brief married life in Switzerland.
After his wife&rsquo;s death (1786) he travelled in Spain and Portugal,
and wrote his <i>Portuguese Letters</i> (published 1834, 1835), which
rank with his best work. He afterwards returned to England,
and after selling his old house, Fonthill Abbey, Wiltshire, began
to build a magnificent residence there, on which he expended in
about eighteen years the sum of £273,000. His eccentricities,
together with the strict seclusion in which he lived, gave rise
to scandal, probably unjustified. In 1822 he sold his house,
together with its splendid library and pictures, to John Farquhar,
and soon after one of the towers, 260 ft. high, fell, destroying
part of the villa in the ruins. Beckford erected another lofty
structure on Lansdowne Hill, near Bath, where he continued to
reside till his death in 1844. His first work,
<i>Biographical Memoirs of Extraordinary Painters</i> (1780)
was a slight, sarcastic <i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i>. In 1782 he wrote in French
his oriental romance, <i>The History of the Caliph Vathek</i>,
which appeared in English, translated by the Rev. Samuel Henley,
in 1786 and has taken its place as one of the finest productions
of luxuriant imagination.</p>

<p>Beckford&rsquo;s wealth and large expenditure, his position as a
collector and patron of letters (he bought Gibbon&rsquo;s library at
Lausanne), his literary industry, and his reputation as author
of <i>Vathek</i>, make him an interesting figure in literary history.
He had a seat in parliament from 1784 to 1793, and again from
1806 to 1820. He left two daughters, the eldest of whom was
married to the 10th duke of Hamilton.</p>

Somerset, and was educated at Winchester and New College,
Oxford. Having entered the church he held many ecclesiastical
appointments, and became dean of the Arches in 1423; then
devoting his time to secular affairs he was sent on an embassy to
Calais in 1439, and to John IV., count of Armagnac, in 1442.
At this time Beckington was acting as secretary to Henry VI.,
and soon after his return in 1443 he was appointed lord privy
seal and bishop of Bath and Wells. The bishop erected many
buildings in Wells, and died there on the 14th of January 1465.

<p><span class="bold">BECKMANN, JOHANN<a name="ar244" id="ar244"></a></span> (1739-1811), German scientific author,
was born on the 4th of June 1739 at Hoya in Hanover, where his
father was postmaster and receiver of taxes. He was educated
at Stade and the university of Göttingen. The death of his
mother in 1762 having deprived him of his means of support,
he went in 1763 on the invitation of the pastor of the Lutheran
community, Anton Friedrich Büsching, the founder of the
modern historic statistical method of geography, to teach natural
history in the Lutheran academy, St Petersburg. This office he
relinquished in 1765, and travelled in Denmark and Sweden,
where he studied the methods of working the mines, and made
the acquaintance of Linnaeus at Upsala. In 1766 he was
appointed extraordinary professor of philosophy at Göttingen.
There he lectured on political and domestic economy with such
success that in 1770 he was appointed ordinary professor. He
was in the habit of taking his students into the workshops,
that they might acquire a practical as well as a theoretical
knowledge of different processes and handicrafts. While thus
engaged he determined to trace the history and describe the
existing condition of each of the arts and sciences on which he
was lecturing, being perhaps incited by the <i>Bibliothecae</i> of
Albrecht von Haller. But even Beckmann&rsquo;s industry and
ardour were unable to overtake the amount of study necessary
for this task. He therefore confined his attention to several
practical arts and trades; and to these labours we owe his
<i>Beiträge zur Geschichte der Erfindungen</i> (1780-1805), translated
into English as the <i>History of Inventions</i>&mdash;a work in which he
relates the origin, history and recent condition of the various
machines, utensils, &amp;c., employed in trade and for domestic
purposes. This work entitles Beckmann to be regarded as the
founder of scientific technology, a term which he was the first
to use in 1772. In 1772 Beckmann was elected a member of the
Royal Society of Göttingen, and he contributed valuable scientific
dissertations to its proceedings until 1783, when he withdrew
from all further share in its work. He died on the 3rd of February
1811. Other important works of Beckmann are
<i>Entwurf einer allgemeinen Technologie</i> (1806);
<i>Anleitung zur Handelswissenschaft</i> (1789);
<i>Vorbereitung zur Warenkunde</i> (1795-1800); <i>Beiträge zur
Ökonomie, Technologie, Polizei- und, Kameralwissenschaft</i> (1777-1791).</p>

He studied in the National Academy of

United States in 1878, he gradually became a prominent figure
in American art. He took an active part in the formation of
the Fine Arts Society, and was president of the National Free
Art League, which attempted to secure the repeal of the American
duty on works of art. Among his portraits are those of W.M. Chase (1882),
of Miss Jordan (1883), of Mark Twain, T.A. Janvier, General Schofield
and William Walton. He decorated one of the domes of the
Manufactures Building at the Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECKWITH, SIR THOMAS SYDNEY<a name="ar246" id="ar246"></a></span> (1772-1831), British general,
was the son of Major-General John Beckwith, who was
colonel of the 20th regiment (Lancashire Fusiliers) in the charge
at Minden. In 1791 he entered the 71st regiment (then commanded
by Colonel David Baird), in which he served in India
and elsewhere until 1800, when he obtained a company in Colonel
Coote Manningham&rsquo;s experimental regiment of riflemen, shortly
afterwards numbered as the 95th Rifles and now called the Rifle
Brigade. In 1802 he was promoted major, and in the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page611" id="page611"></a>611</span>
year lieutenant-colonel. Beckwith was one of the favourite
officers of Sir John Moore in the famous camp of Shorncliffe, and
aided that general in the training of the troops which afterwards
became the Light Division. In 1806 he served in the expedition
to Hanover, and in 1807 in that which captured Copenhagen. In
1806 the Rifles were present at Vimeira, and in the campaign of
Sir John Moore they bore the brunt of the rearguard fighting.
Beckwith took part in the great march of Craufurd to the field of
Talavera, in the advanced guard fights on the Coa in 1810 and
in the campaign in Portugal. On the formation of the Light
Division he was given a brigade command in it. After the
brilliant action of Sabugal, Beckwith had to retire for a time
from active service, but the Rifles and the brigade he had
trained and commanded added to their fame on every subsequent
battlefield. In 1812 he went to Canada as assistant
quartermaster-general, and he took part in the war against the
United States. In 1814 he became major-general, and in 1815 was
created K.C.B. In 1827 he was made colonel commandant of the
Rifle Brigade. He went to India as commander-in-chief at Bombay
in 1829, and was promoted lieutenant-general in the following year.
He died on the 15th of January 1831 at Mahableshwar.</p>

<p>His elder brother, Sir <span class="sc">George Beckwith</span> (1753-1823), distinguished
himself as a regimental officer in the American War
of Independence, and served subsequently in high administrative
posts and in numerous successful military operations in the
West Indies during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.
He was made a K.B. for his capture of Martinique in 1809,
and attained the full rank of general in 1814. Sir George Beckwith
commanded the forces in Ireland, 1816-1820.
He died in London on the 20th of March 1823.</p>

<p>Their nephew, Major-General <span class="sc">John Charles Beckwith</span> (1789-1862),
joined the 50th regiment in 1803, exchanging in
1804 into the 95th Rifles, with which regiment he served in
the Peninsular campaigns of 1808-10. He was subsequently
employed on the staff of the Light Division, and he was repeatedly
mentioned in despatches, becoming in 1814 a brevet-major,
and after the battle of Waterloo (in which he lost a leg)
lieutenant-colonel and C.B. In 1820 he left active service.
Seven years later an accident drew his attention to the Waldenses,
whose past history and present condition influenced him so
strongly that he settled in the valleys of Piedmont. The rest
of his life was spent in the self-imposed task of educating
the Waldenses, for whom he established and maintained a large
number of schools, and in reviving the earlier faith of the people.
In 1848 King Charles Albert made him a knight of the order of
St Maurice and St Lazarus. He was promoted colonel in the
British army in 1837 and major-general in 1846. He died on
the 19th of July 1862 at La Torre, Piedmont.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECKX, PIERRE JEAN<a name="ar247" id="ar247"></a></span> (1795-1887), general of the Society
of Jesus, was born at Sichem in Belgium on the 8th of February 1795,
and entered the novitiate of the order at Hildesheim in 1819.
His first important post was as procurator for the province
of Austria, 1847; next year he became rector of the Jesuit
college at Louvain, and, after serving as secretary to the
provincials of Belgium and Austria, was elected head of the order
in 1853. His tenure of office was marked by an increased zeal
for missions in Protestant lands, and by the removal of the
society&rsquo;s headquarters from Rome to Fiesole near Florence in 1870.
His chief literary work was the often-translated
<i>Month of Mary</i> (Vienna, 1843). He retired in September 1883,
being succeeded by Anthony M. Anderledy, a Swiss, who had seen
service in the United States. He died at Rome on the 4th of March 1887.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BECQUE, HENRY FRANÇOIS<a name="ar248" id="ar248"></a></span> (1837-1899), French dramatist,
was born on the 9th of April 1837 in Paris. He wrote the book
of an opera <i>Sardanapale</i> in imitation of Lord Byron for the
music of M. Victorin Joncières in 1867, but his first important
work, <i>Michel Pauper</i>, appeared in 1870. The importance of this
sombre drama was first realized when it was revived at the
Odéon in 1886. <i>Les Corbeaux</i> (1882) established Becque&rsquo;s position
as an innovator, and in 1885 he produced his most successful
play, <i>La Parisienne</i>. Becque produced little during the last
years of his life, but his disciples carried on the tradition he had
created. He died in May 1899.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BÉCQUER, GUSTAVO ADOLFO<a name="ar249" id="ar249"></a></span> (1836-1870), Spanish poet and
romance-writer, was born at Seville on the 17th of February
1836. Left an orphan at an early age, he was educated by his
godmother, refused to adopt any profession, and drifted to
Madrid, where he obtained a small post in the civil service.
He was dismissed for carelessness, became an incorrigible
Bohemian, and earned a precarious living by translating foreign
novels; he died in great poverty at Madrid on the 22nd of
December 1870. His works were published posthumously in 1873.
In such prose tales as <i>El Rayo de Luna</i> and <i>La Mujer de
piedra</i>, Bécquer is manifestly influenced by Hoffmann, and as a
poet he has analogies with Heine. He dwells in a fairyland of
his own, crooning a weird elfin music which has no parallel in
Spanish; his work is unfinished and unequal, but it is singularly
free from the rhetoric characteristic of his native Andalusia,
and its lyrical ardour is of a beautiful sweetness and sincerity.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BECQUEREL,<a name="ar250" id="ar250"></a></span> the name of a French family, several members
of which have been distinguished in chemical and physical
research.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Antoine César Becquerel</span> (1788-1878), was born at Châtillon
sur Loing on the 8th of March 1788. After passing through the
École Polytechnique he became <i>ingénieur-officier</i> in 1808, and
saw active service with the imperial troops in Spain from 1810
to 1812, and again in France in 1814. He then resigned from
the army and devoted the rest of his life to scientific investigation.
His earliest work was mineralogical in character, but he soon
turned his attention to the study of electricity and especially
of electrochemistry. In 1837 he received the Copley medal
from the Royal Society &ldquo;for his various memoirs on electricity,
and particularly for those on the production of metallic sulphurets
and sulphur by the long-continued action of electricity of very
low tension,&rdquo; which it was hoped would lead to increased knowledge
of the &ldquo;recomposition of crystallized bodies, and the
processes which may have been employed by nature in the
production of such bodies in the mineral kingdom.&rdquo; In biological
chemistry he worked at the problems of animal heat and
at the phenomena accompanying the growth of plants, and he
also devoted much time to meteorological questions and
observations.  He was a prolific writer, his books including
<i>Traité d&rsquo;électricité et du magnétisme</i> (1834-1840),
<i>Traité de physique dans ses rapports avec la chimie</i> (1842),
<i>Éléments de l&rsquo;électro-chimie</i> (1843),
<i>Traité complet du magnétisme</i> (1845),
<i>Éléments de physique terrestre et de météorologie</i> (1847), and
<i>Des climats et de l&rsquo;influence qu&rsquo;exercent
les sols boisés et déboisés</i> (1853). He died on the 18th
of January 1878 in Paris, where from 1837 he had been professor
of physics at the Musée d&rsquo;Histoire Naturelle.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Alexandre Edmond Becquerel</span> (1820-1891), was
born in Paris on the 24th of March 1820, and was in turn his
pupil, assistant and successor at the Musée d&rsquo;Histoire Naturelle;
he was also appointed professor at the short-lived Agronomic
Institute at Versailles in 1849, and in 1853 received the chair
of physics at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers. Edmond
Becquerel was associated with his father in much of his work,
but he himself paid special attention to the study of light,
investigating the photochemical effects and spectroscopic
characters of solar radiation and the electric light, and the
phenomena of phosphorescence, particularly as displayed by
the sulphides and by compounds of uranium. It was in connexion
with these latter inquiries that he devised his phosphoroscope,
an apparatus which enabled the interval between exposure
to the source of light and observation of the resulting effects to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page612" id="page612"></a>612</span>
be varied at will and accurately measured. He published in
1867-1868 a treatise in two volumes on <i>La Lumière, ses causes
et ses effets</i>. He also investigated the diamagnetic and paramagnetic properties of substances; and was keenly interested
in the phenomena of electrochemical decomposition, accumulating
much evidence in favour of Faraday&rsquo;s law and proposing
a modified statement of it which was intended to cover certain
apparent exceptions. He died in Paris on the 11th of May 1891.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Antoine Henri Becquerel</span> (1852-1908), son of the last-named,
who succeeded to his chair at the Musée d&rsquo;Histoire
Naturelle in 1892, was born in Paris on the 15th of December
1852, studied at the École Polytechnique, where he was appointed
a professor in 1895, and in 1875 entered the department <i>des
ponts et chaussées</i>, of which in 1894 he became <i>ingénieur en chef</i>. He was distinguished as the discoverer of radioactivity, having found in 1896 that uranium at ordinary temperatures emits an
invisible radiation which in many respects resembles Röntgen
rays, and can affect a photographic plate after passing through
thin plates of metal. For his researches in this department he
was in 1903 awarded a Nobel prize jointly with Pierre Curie.
He also engaged in work on magnetism, the polarization of light,
phosphorescence and the absorption of light in crystals. He
died at Croisic in Brittany on the 25th of August 1908.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BED<a name="ar251" id="ar251"></a></span> (a common Teutonic word, cf. German <i>Bett</i>, probably
connected with the Indo-European root <i>bhodh</i>, seen in the
Lat. <i>fodere</i>, to dig; so &ldquo;a dug-out place&rdquo; for safe resting, or
in the same sense as a garden &ldquo;bed&rdquo;), a general term for a
resting or sleeping place for men and animals, and in particular
for the article of household furniture for that object, and so used
by analogy in other senses, involving a supporting surface or
layer. The accompaniments of a domestic bed (bedding, coverlets,
etc.) have naturally varied considerably in different times,
and its form and decoration and social associations have considerable
historical interest. The Egyptians had high bedsteads
which were ascended by steps, with bolsters or pillows, and
curtains to hang round. Often there was a head-rest as well,
semi-cylindrical and made of stone, wood or metal. Assyrians,
Medes and Persians had beds of a similar kind, and frequently
decorated their furniture with inlays or <i>appliqués</i> of metal,
mother-of-pearl and ivory. The oldest account of a bedstead
is probably that of Ulysses which Homer describes him as making
in his own house, but he also mentions the inlaying of the woodwork
of beds with gold, silver and ivory. The Greek bed had
a wooden frame, with a board at the head and bands of hide
laced across, upon which skins were placed. At a later period
the bedstead was often veneered with expensive woods; sometimes
it was of solid ivory veneered with tortoise-shell and with
silver feet; often it was of bronze. The pillows and coverings
also became more costly and beautiful; the most celebrated
places for their manufacture were Miletus, Corinth and Carthage.
Folding beds, too, appear in the vase paintings. The Roman
mattresses were stuffed with reeds, hay, wool or feathers; the
last was used towards the end of the Republic, when custom
demanded luxury. Small cushions were placed at the head
and sometimes at the back. The bedsteads were high and could
only be ascended by the help of steps. They were often arranged
for two persons, and had a board or railing at the back as well
as the raised portion at the head. The counterpanes were sometimes
very costly, generally purple embroidered with figures
in gold; and rich hangings fell to the ground masking the front.
The bedsteads themselves were often of bronze inlaid with silver,
and Elagabalus, like some modern Indian princes, had one of
solid silver. In the walls of some of the houses at Pompeii
bed niches are found which were probably closed by curtains
or sliding partitions. The marriage bed, <i>lectus genialis</i>,
was much decorated, and was placed in the atrium opposite the door. A
low pallet-bed used for sick persons was known as <i>scimpodium</i>.
Other forms of couch were called <i>lectus</i>, but were not beds in
the modern sense of the word except the <i>lectus funebris</i>, on
which the body of a dead person lay in state for seven days,
clad in a toga and rich garments, and surrounded by flowers and foliage.
This bed rested on ivory legs, over which purple blankets
embroidered with gold were spread, and was placed in the atrium
with the foot to the door and with a pan of incense by its side.
The ancient Germans lay on the floor on beds of leaves covered
with skins, or in a kind of shallow chest filled with leaves and
moss. In the early middle ages they laid carpets on the floor
or on a bench against the wall, placed upon them mattresses
stuffed with feathers, wool or hair, and used skins as a covering.
They appear to have generally lain naked in bed, wrapping themselves
in the large linen sheets which were stretched over the
cushions. In the 13th century luxury increased, and bedsteads
were made of wood much decorated with inlaid, carved and
painted ornament. They also used folding beds, which served
as couches by day and had cushions covered with silk laid upon
leather. At night a linen sheet was spread and pillows placed,
while silk-covered skins served as coverlets. Curtains were hung
from the ceiling or from an iron arm projecting from the wall.
The Carolingian MSS. show metal bedsteads much higher at
the head than at the feet, and this shape continued in use till
the 13th century in France, many cushions being added to raise
the body to a sloping position. In the 12th-century MSS. the
bedsteads appear much richer, with inlays, carving and painting,
and with embroidered coverlets and mattresses in harmony.
Curtains were hung above the bed, and a small hanging lamp
is often shown. In the 14th century the woodwork became of
less importance, being generally entirely covered by hangings
of rich materials. Silk, velvet and even cloth of gold were much
used. Inventories from the beginning of the 14th century give
details of these hangings lined with fur and richly embroidered.
Then it was that the tester bed made its first appearance, the
tester being slung from the ceiling or fastened to the walls,
a form which developed later into a room within a room, shut
in by double curtains, sometimes even so as to exclude all
draughts. The space between bed and wall was called the
<i>ruelle</i>, and very intimate friends were received there. In the
15th century beds became very large, reaching to 7 or 8 ft.
by 6 or 7 ft. Viollet-le-Duc says that the mattresses were filled
with pea-shucks or straw&mdash;neither wool nor horsehair is
mentioned&mdash;but feathers also were used. At this time great
personages were in the habit of carrying most of their property
about with them, including beds and bed-hangings, and for this
reason the bedsteads were for the most part mere frameworks
to be covered up; but about the beginning of the 16th century
bedsteads were made lighter and more decorative, since the
lords remained in the same place for longer periods. In the
museum at Nancy is a fine bedstead of this period which belonged
to Antoine de Lorraine. It has a carved head and foot as well
as the uprights which support the tester. Another is in the
Musée Cluny ascribed to Pierre de Gondi, very architectural in
design, with a bracketed cornice, and turned and carved posts;
at the head figures of warriors watch the sleeper. Louis XIV.
had an enormous number of sumptuous beds, as many as 413
being described in the inventories of his palaces. Some of them
had embroideries enriched with pearls, and figures on a silver
or golden ground. The carving was the work of Proux or
Caffieri, and the gilding by La Baronnière. The great bed at
Versailles had crimson velvet curtains on which &ldquo;The Triumph
of Venus&rdquo; was embroidered. So much gold was used that
the velvet scarcely showed. Under the influence of Madame
de Maintenon &ldquo;The Sacrifice of Abraham,&rdquo; which is now on
the tester, replaced &ldquo;The Triumph of Venus.&rdquo; In the 17th
century, which has been called &ldquo;the century of magnificent
beds,&rdquo; the style <i>à la duchesse</i>, with tester and curtains
only at the head, replaced the more enclosed beds in France, though
they lasted much longer in England. In the 18th century
feather pillows were first used as coverings in Germany, which
in the fashions of the bed and the curious etiquette connected
with the bedchamber followed France for the most part. The
beds were <i>à la duchesse</i>, but in France itself there was great
variety both of name and shape&mdash;the <i>lit à alcove, lit d&rsquo;ange</i>,
which had no columns, but a suspended tester with curtains
drawn back, <i>lit à l&rsquo;Anglaise</i>, which looked like a high sofa by
day, <i>lit en baldaquin</i>, with the tester fixed against the wall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page613" id="page613"></a>613</span>
<i>lit à couronne</i> with a tester shaped like a crown, a style which
appeared under Louis XVI., and was fashionable under the
Restoration and Louis Philippe, and <i>lit à l&rsquo;impériale</i>, which had
a curved tester, are a few of their varieties. The <i>lit en baldaquin</i>
of Napoleon I. is still at Fontainebleau, and the Garde Meuble
contains several richly carved beds of a more modern date.
The custom of the &ldquo;bed of justice&rdquo; upon which the king of
France reclined when he was present in parliament, the princes
being seated, the great officials standing, and the lesser officials
kneeling, was held to denote the royal power even more than the
throne. Louis XI. is credited with its first use, and the custom
lasted till the end of the monarchy. From the habit of using
this bed to hear petitions, &amp;c., came the usage of the <i>grand lit</i>,
which was provided wherever the king stayed, called also <i>lit de
parement</i> or <i>lit de parade</i>, rather later. Upon this bed the dead
king lay in state. The beds of the king and queen were saluted
by the courtiers as if they were altars, and none approached them
even when there was no railing to prevent it. These railings
were apparently placed for other than ceremonial reasons
originally, and in the accounts of several castles in the 15th
century mention is made of a railing to keep dogs from the bed.
In the <i>chambre de parade</i>, where the ceremonial bed was placed,
certain persons, such as ambassadors or great lords, whom it
was desired to honour, were received in a more intimate fashion
than the crowd of courtiers. The <i>petit lever</i> was held in the
bedroom itself, the <i>grand lever</i> in the <i>chambre de parade</i>.
At Versailles women received their friends in their beds, both before
and after childbirth, during periods of mourning, and even
directly after marriage&mdash;in fact in any circumstances which
were thought deserving of congratulation or condolence. During
the 17th century this curious custom became general, perhaps to
avoid the tiresome details of etiquette. Portable beds were used
in high society in France till the end of the <i>ancien régime</i>. The
earliest of which mention has been found belonged to Charles
the Bold (see <i>Memoirs</i> of Philippe de Comines). They had
curtains over a light framework, and were in their way as fine
as the stationary beds. Iron beds appear in the 18th century;
the advertisements recommend them as free from the insects
which sometimes infested wooden bedsteads, but one is mentioned
in the inventory of the furniture of the castle of Nerac in 1569,
&ldquo;un lit de fer et de cuivre, avec quatre petites colonnes de laiton,
ensemble quatre satyres de laiton, quatre petits vases de laiton
pour mettre sur les colonnes; dedans le dit lit il y a la figure
d&rsquo;Olopherne ensemble de Judith, qui sont d&rsquo;albâtre.&rdquo; In
Scotland, Brittany and Holland the closed bed with sliding or
folding shutters has persisted till our own day, and in
England&mdash;where beds were commonly quite simple in form&mdash;the
four-poster, with tester and curtains all round, was the usual
citizen&rsquo;s bed till the middle of the 19th century. Many fine
examples exist of 17th-century carved oak bedsteads, some of
which have found their way into museums. The later forms, in which
mahogany was usually the wood employed, are much less architectural
in design. Some exceedingly elegant mahogany bedsteads
were designed by Chippendale, Hepplewhite and Sheraton,
and there are signs that English taste is returning to the wooden
bedstead in a lighter and less monumental form.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BED,<a name="ar252" id="ar252"></a></span> in geology, a term for certain kinds of rock usually
found to be arranged in more or less distinct layers; these are
the beds of rock or strata. Normally, the bedding of rocks is
horizontal or very nearly so; when the upper and lower surfaces
of a bed are parallel, the bedding is said to be regular; if it is
thickest at one point and thins away thence in every direction,
the bedding is lenticular. Beds may be thick (50 ft. or more)
or so thin as to be like sheets of paper, <i>e.g.</i> paper shales, such
thin beds being often termed layers or laminae; intermediate
regular varieties may be called flags, flagstones or tilestones.
In fine-grained rocks the bedding is usually thinner and more
regular than in coarser rocks, such as sandstones and grits.
Bedding is confined to rocks which have been formed under
water or by the agency of wind; these are the &ldquo;stratified&rdquo;
rocks.</p>

<p>The deposition of rock material by moving water is not as
a rule uniform, slight changes in the velocity produce an
immediate change in the size of the particles deposited upon a
given area; thus a coarse sand layer may be succeeded by a finer
sand or a mud, or two sandy layers may be separated by a thin
layer of muddy shale. Bedding is most often induced by a change
in the nature of the contiguous strata; thus a sandstone is
followed by a shale or vice versa&mdash;changes which may be due
to the varying volume or velocity of a current. Or the nature
of the deposit may be influenced by chemical actions, whereby
we get beds of rock-salt or gypsum between beds of marl. Or
again, organic activities may influence the deposit, beds of coal
may succeed layers of shale, iron-stone may lie between limestones
or clays, a layer of large fossils or of flints may determine
a bedding plane in massive limestones. Flaky minerals like
mica frequently assist in the formation of bedding planes;
and the pressure of superincumbent strata upon earlier formed
deposits has no doubt often produced a tendency in the particles
to arrange themselves normal to the direction of pressure,
thus causing the rock to split more readily along the same
direction.</p>

<p>Where rapidly-moving currents of water (or air) are transporting
or depositing sand, &amp;c., the bedding is generally not
horizontal, but inclined more or less steeply; this brings about
the formation of what is variously called &ldquo;cross-bedding,&rdquo;
&ldquo;diagonal bedding&rdquo;, &ldquo;current bedding&rdquo; or improperly &ldquo;false-bedding.&rdquo;
Igneous materials, when deposited through the
agency of water or air, exhibit bedding, but no true stratification
is seen in igneous rocks that have solidified after cooling,
although in granites and similar rocks the process of weathering
frequently produces an appearance resembling this structure.
Miners not infrequently describe a bed of rock as a &ldquo;vein,&rdquo; if
it is one that has some economic value, <i>e.g.</i> a &ldquo;vein of coal
or ironstone.&rdquo;</p>

Pop. (1906) 5594. The town has a 16th-century church, a board of
trade arbitration, a chamber of arts and manufactures, a communal
college and a school of drawing. Bédarieux was at one
time a notable manufacturing centre. Its cloth-weaving industry,
carried on under a special royal privilege from the end of the 17th
century to the Revolution, employed in 1789 as many as 5000
workmen, while some thousand more were occupied in wool
and cotton spinning, &amp;c. In spite of the introduction of modern
machinery from England, the industries of the place declined,
mainly owing to the loss of the trade with the Levant; but of
late years they have somewhat revived, owing partly to the
opening up of coal mines in the neighbourhood. Besides cloth
factories and wool-spinning mills, there are now numerous
tanneries and leather-dressing works. There is some trade in
timber, wool and agricultural produce.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEDDGELERT<a name="ar255" id="ar255"></a></span> (&ldquo;Gelert&rsquo;s grave&rdquo;), a village in Carnarvonshire,
North Wales, at the foot of Snowdon. The tradition of
Gelert, Llewelyn&rsquo;s hound, being buried there is old in Wales;
and common to it and India is the legend of a dog (or ichneumon)
saving a child from a beast of prey (or reptile), and being killed
by the child&rsquo;s father under the delusion that the animal had
slain the infant. The English poet, W.R. Spencer, has versified
the tale of Llewelyn, king of Wales, leaving Gelert and the baby
prince at home, returning to find Gelert stained with the blood
of a wolf, and killing the hound because he thought his child was
slain. Sir W. Jones, the Welsh philologist and linguist, gives
the Indian equivalent (Lord Teignmouth&rsquo;s <i>Life of Jones</i>,
ed. Rev. S.C. Wilkes, editor&rsquo;s supplement). A Brahmin, leaving
home, left his daughter in charge of an ichneumon, which he had
long cherished. A black snake came up and was killed by the
ichneumon, mistakenly killed, in its turn, by the Brahmin on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page614" id="page614"></a>614</span>
his coming back. Another version is the medieval romance in
<i>The Seven Wise Masters of Rome</i>. In the edition printed by
Wynkyn de Worde it is told by &ldquo;the first master&rdquo;&mdash;a knight
had one son, a greyhound and a falcon; the knight went to
a tourney, a snake attacked the son, the falcon roused the hound,
which killed the serpent, lay down by the cradle, and was killed
by the knight, who discovered his error, like Llewelyn, and
similarly repented (Villon Society, British Museum reprint, by
Gomme and Wheatley).</p>

<p>On the west of Beddgelert is Moel Hebog (Bare-hill of the
falcon), a hiding-place of Owen Glendower. Here, in 1784, was
found a brass Roman shield. Near is the famous Aberglaslyn
Pass, dividing Carnarvon and Merioneth. In the centre is
Cadair Rhys Goch o&rsquo;r Eryri, a rock named as the chair of Rhys
Goch, a bard contemporary with Glendower (died traditionally,
1429). Not far hence passed the Roman road from Uriconium
to Segontium (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carnarvon</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEDDOES, THOMAS<a name="ar256" id="ar256"></a></span> (1760-1808), English physician and
scientific writer, was born at Shiffnall in Shropshire on the 13th
of April 1760. After being educated at Bridgnorth grammar
school and at Pembroke College, Oxford, he studied medicine in
London under John Sheldon (1752-1808). In 1784 he published
a translation of L. Spallanzani&rsquo;s <i>Dissertations on Natural History</i>,
and in 1785 produced a translation, with original notes, of
T.O. Bergman&rsquo;s <i>Essays on Elective Attractions</i>. He took his
degree of doctor of medicine at Oxford in 1786, and, after visiting
Paris, where he became acquainted with Lavoisier, was appointed
reader in chemistry at Oxford University in 1788. His lectures
attracted large and appreciative audiences; but his sympathy
with the French Revolution exciting a clamour against him, he
resigned his readership in 1792. In the following year he published
<i>Observations on the Nature of Demonstrative Evidence</i>, and
the <i>History of Isaac Jenkins</i>, a story which powerfully exhibits
the evils of drunkenness, and of which 40,000 copies are reported
to have been sold. About the same time he began to work at
his project for the establishment of a &ldquo;Pneumatic Institution&rdquo;
for treating disease by the inhalation of different gases. In this
he was assisted by Richard Lovell Edgeworth, whose daughter,
Anna, became his wife in 1794. In 1798 the institution was
established at Clifton, its first superintendent being Humphry
Davy, who investigated the properties of nitrous oxide in its
laboratory. The original aim of the institution was gradually
abandoned; it became an ordinary sick-hospital, and was
relinquished by its projector in the year before his death, which
occurred on the 24th of December 1808. Beddoes was a man of
great powers and wide acquirements, which he directed to noble
and philanthropic purposes. He strove to effect social good by
popularizing medical knowledge, a work for which his vivid
imagination and glowing eloquence eminently fitted him.
Besides the writings mentioned above, he was the author of
<i>Political Pamphlets</i> (1795-1797), a popular <i>Essay
on Consumption</i> (1799), which won the admiration of Kant,
an <i>Essay on Fever</i> (1807), and <i>Hygeia, or Essays Moral
and Medical</i> (1807). He also edited John Brown&rsquo;s <i>Elements
of Medicine</i> (1795), and <i>Contributions to Physical and Medical
Knowledge, principally from the West of England</i> (1799).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A life of Beddoes by Dr John E. Stock was published in 1810.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEDDOES, THOMAS LOVELL<a name="ar257" id="ar257"></a></span> (1803-1849), English dramatist
and poet, son of the physician, Thomas Beddoes, was born at
Clifton on the 20th of July 1803. His mother was a sister of
Maria Edgeworth, the novelist. He was sent to Bath grammar
school and then to the Charterhouse. At school he wrote a good
deal of verse and a novel in imitation of Fielding. In 1820 he
was entered at Pembroke College, Oxford, and in his first year
published <i>The Improvisatore</i>, afterwards carefully suppressed,
and in 1822 <i>The Bride&rsquo;s Tragedy</i>, which showed him as the
disciple of the later Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists. The
play found a small circle of admirers, and procured for Beddoes
the friendship of Bryan Waller Procter (Barry Cornwall).
Beddoes retired to Southampton to read for his degree, and
there Procter introduced him to a young lawyer, Thomas Forbes
Kelsall, with whom he became very intimate, and who became
his biographer and editor. At this time he composed the dramatic
fragments of <i>The Second Brother</i> and <i>Torrismond</i>.
Unfortunately he lacked the power of constructing a plot, and
seemed to suffer from a constitutional inability to finish
anything. Beddoes was one of the first outside the limited circle
of Shelley&rsquo;s own friends to recognize Shelley&rsquo;s genius, and he
was certainly one of the earliest imitators of his lyrical method.
In the summer of 1824 he was summoned to Florence by the
illness of his mother, but she died before he arrived. He remained
some time in Italy, and met Mrs Shelley and Walter Savage
Landor before he returned to England. In 1825 he took his
degree at Oxford, and in that year he began what he calls
(<i>Letters</i>, p. 68) &ldquo;a very Gothic styled tragedy&rdquo; with &ldquo;a jewel
of a name.&rdquo; This work was completed in 1829 as the fantastic
and incoherent drama, <i>Death&rsquo;s Jest Book or The Fool&rsquo;s Tragedy</i>;
but he continued to revise it until his death, and it was only
published posthumously. On leaving Oxford he decided to
study anatomy and physiology, not, however, without some hope
that his studies might, by increasing his knowledge of the human
mechanism, further his efforts as a dramatist. In the autumn
of 1825 he entered on his studies at Göttingen, where he remained
for four years. In 1829 he removed to Würzburg, and in 1832
obtained his doctorate in medicine, but his intimate association
with democratic and republican leaders in Germany and Switzerland
forced him to leave Bavaria without receiving his diploma.
He settled in Zürich, where he practised for some time as a
physician, and was even elected to be professor of comparative
anatomy at the university, but the authorities refused to ratify
his appointment because of his revolutionary views. He frequently
contributed political poems and articles to German and
Swiss papers, but none of his German work has been identified.
The years at Zürich seem to have been the happiest of his life,
but in 1839 the anti-liberal riots in the town rendered it unsafe
for him, and early in the next year he had to escape secretly.
From this time he had no settled home, though he stored his
books at Baden in Aargau. His long residence in Germany was
only broken by visits to England in 1828 to take his master of
arts degree, in 1835, in 1842 and for some months in 1846. He
had adopted German thought and manners to such an extent
that he hardly felt at home in England; and his study of the
German language, which he had begun in 1825, had almost
weaned him from his mother-tongue; he was, as he says in a
letter, &ldquo;a non-conductor of friendship&rdquo;; and it is not surprising
that his old friends found him much changed and eccentric. In
1847 he returned to Frankfort, where he lived with a baker
called Degen, to whom he became much attached, and whom
he persuaded to become an actor. He took Degen with him to
Zürich, where he chartered the theatre for one night to give his
friend a chance of playing Hotspur. The two separated at
Basel, and in a fit of dejection (May 1848) Beddoes tried to bleed
himself to death. He was taken to the hospital, and wrote to
his friends in England that he had had a fall from horseback.
His leg was amputated, and he was in a fair way to recovery
when, on the first day he was allowed to leave the hospital, he
took curare, from the effects of which he died on the 26th of
January 1849. His MSS. he left in the charge of his friend Kelsall.</p>

<p>In one of his letters to Kelsall Beddoes wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;I am
convinced the man who is to awaken the drama must be a bold,
trampling fellow&mdash;no creeper into worm-holes&mdash;no reviser
even&mdash;however good. These reanimations are vampire cold. Such
ghosts as Marloe, Webster, &amp;c., are better dramatists, better
poets, I dare say, than any contemporaries of ours&mdash;but they
are ghosts&mdash;the worm is in their pages&rdquo; (<i>Letters</i>, p. 50). In
spite of this wise judgment, Beddoes was himself a &ldquo;creeper into
worm-holes,&rdquo; a close imitator of Marston and of Cyril Tourneur,
especially in their familiar handling of the phenomena of death,
and in the remoteness from ordinary life of the passions
portrayed. In his blank verse he caught to a certain degree the
manner of his Jacobean models, and his verse abounds in beautiful
imagery, but his <i>Death&rsquo;s Jest Book</i> is only finished in the
sense of having five acts completed; it remains a bizarre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page615" id="page615"></a>615</span>
production which appeals to few minds, and to them rather for
the occasional excellence of the poetry than as an entire composition.
His lyrics show the influence of Shelley as well as the
study of 17th-century models, but they are by no means mere
imitations, and some of them, like the &ldquo;Dirge for Wolfram&rdquo;
(&ldquo;If thou wilt ease thy heart&rdquo;), and &ldquo;Dream Pedlary&rdquo; (&ldquo;If
there were dreams to sell&rdquo;), are among the most exquisite of
19th-century lyrics.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Kelsall published Beddoes&rsquo; great work, <i>Death&rsquo;s Jest Book: or, The
Fool&rsquo;s Tragedy</i>, in 1850. The drama is based on the story that a
certain Duke Boleslaus of Münsterberg was stabbed by his court-fool,
the &ldquo;Isbrand&rdquo; of the play (see C.F. Floegel, <i>Geschichte der
Hofnarren</i>, Leipzig, 1789, pp. 297 et seq.). He followed this in 1851
with <i>Poems of the late Thomas Lovell Beddoes</i>, to which a memoir was
prefixed. The two volumes were printed together (1851) with the
title of <i>Poems, Posthumous and Collected</i>. All these volumes are
very rare. Kelsall bequeathed the Beddoes MSS. to Robert Browning,
with a note stating the real history of Beddoes&rsquo; illness and death,
which was kept back out of consideration for his relatives. Browning
is reported to have said that if he were ever Professor of Poetry his
first lecture would be on Beddoes, &ldquo;a forgotten Oxford poet.&rdquo; Mr
Edmund Gosse obtained permission to use the documents from
Browning, and edited a fuller selection of the <i>Poetical Works</i> (2 vols.,
1890) for the &ldquo;Temple Library,&rdquo; supplying a full account of his life.
He also edited the <i>Letters of Thomas Lovell Beddoes</i> (1894), containing
a selection from his correspondence, which is full of gaiety and
contains much amusing literary criticism. See also the edition of
Beddoes by Ramsay Colles in the &ldquo;Muses&rsquo; Library&rdquo; (1906).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEDE,<a name="ar258" id="ar258"></a></span> <span class="sc">Beda</span>, or <span class="sc">Bæda</span> (672 or 673-735), English historian
and theologian. Of Bæda, commonly called &ldquo;the Venerable
Bede,&rdquo; almost all that we know is contained in the short autobiographical
notice which he has appended to his <i>Ecclesiastical
History</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;Thus much concerning the ecclesiastical history of
Britain, and especially of the race of the English, I, Baeda, a
servant of Christ and priest of the monastery of the blessed
apostles St Peter and St Paul, which is at Wearmouth and at
Jarrow, have with the Lord&rsquo;s help composed, so far as I could
gather it, either from ancient documents, or from the tradition
of the elders, or from my own knowledge. I was born in the
territory of the said monastery, and at the age of seven I was,
by the care of my relations, given to the reverend Abbot Benedict
(Biscop), and afterwards to Ceolfrid, to be educated. From
that time I have spent the whole of my life within that monastery
devoting all my pains to the study of the scriptures; and amid
the observance of monastic discipline, and the daily charge of
singing in the church, it has ever been my delight to learn or
teach or write. In my nineteenth year I was admitted to the
diaconate, in my thirtieth to the priesthood, both by the hands
of the most reverend Bishop John (of Hexham), and at the
bidding of Abbot Ceolfrid. From the time of my admission to
the priesthood to my (present) fifty-ninth year, I have endeavoured,
for my own use and that of my brethren, to make
brief notes upon the Holy Scripture, either out of the works of
the venerable fathers, or in conformity with their meaning and
interpretation.&rdquo; Then follows a list of his works, so far as, at
that date, they had been composed. As the <i>Ecclesiastical
History</i> was written in 731, we obtain the following dates for
the principal events in Bede&rsquo;s uneventful life:&mdash;birth, 672-673;
entrance into the monastery, 679-680; ordination as deacon,
691-692; as priest, 702-703.</p>

<p>The monastery of Wearmouth was founded by Benedict
Biscop in 674, and that of Jarrow in 681-682. Though some 5 or 6
m. apart, they were intended to form a single monastery under
a single abbot, and so Bede speaks of them in the passage given
above. It is with Jarrow that Bede is chiefly associated, though
no doubt from the close connexion of the two localities he would
often be at Wearmouth. The preface to the prose life of Cuthbert
proves that he had stayed at Lindisfarne prior to 721, while the
Epistle to Egbert shows that he had visited him at York in 733.
The tradition that he went to Rome in obedience to a summons
from Pope Sergius is contradicted by his own words above, and
by his total silence as to any such visit. In the passage cited
above, &ldquo;monastic discipline, the daily charge of singing in the
church, learning, teaching, writing,&rdquo; in other words devotion
and study make up the even tenor of Bede&rsquo;s tranquil life. Anecdotes
have been preserved which illustrate his piety both in
early and in later years; of his studies the best monument is to
be found in his writings. As a little boy he would take his place
among the pupils of the monastic school, though he would soon
pass to the ranks of the teachers, and the fact that he was
ordained deacon at nineteen, below the canonical age, shows that
he was regarded as remarkable both for learning and goodness.</p>

<p>For the rest, it is in his works that we must chiefly seek to
know him. They fall into three main classes: (1) scientific;
(2) historical; (3) theological. The first class comprises works
on grammar, one on natural phenomena, and two on chronology
and the calendar. These last were inspired largely by the
Paschal Question, which was the subject of such bitter controversy
between the Roman and Celtic Churches in the 7th century.
They form a natural transition to the second class. In this the
chief place is held by the <i>Ecclesiastical History of the English
Nation</i>. By this Bede has justly earned the title of the Father
of English History. By this almost exclusively he is known to
others than professed students. It is indeed one of the most
valuable and one of the most beautiful of historical works.
Bede has the artist&rsquo;s instinct of proportion, the artist&rsquo;s sense
for the picturesque and the pathetic. His style too, modelled
largely, in the present writer&rsquo;s opinion, on that of Gregory in the
<i>Dialogues</i>, is limpid and unaffected. And though it would be
wrong to call Bede a critical historian in the modern sense of the
words, he shows a very unusual conscientiousness in collecting
his information from the best available sources, and in distinguishing
between what he believed to be fact, and what he
regarded only as rumour or tradition. Other historical works
of Bede are the <i>History of the Abbots</i> (of Wearmouth and Jarrow),
and the lives of Cuthbert in verse and prose. The <i>History of the
Abbots</i> and the prose life of Cuthbert were based on earlier works
which still survive. In the case of the latter it cannot honestly
be said that Bede has improved on his original. In the <i>History
of the Abbots</i> he was much nearer to the facts, and could make
additions out of his own personal knowledge. The Epistle to
Egbert, though not historical in form, may be mentioned here,
because of the valuable information which it contains as to
the state of the Northumbrian Church, on which the disorders
and revolutions of the Northumbrian kingdom had told with
disastrous effect. It is probably the latest of Bede&rsquo;s extant
works, as it was written in November 734, only six months
before his death. The third or theological class of writings
consists mainly of commentaries, or of works which, if not
commentaries in name, are so in fact. They are based largely
on the works of the four great Latin Fathers, SS. Augustine,
Jerome, Ambrose and Gregory; though Bede&rsquo;s reading is very
far from being limited to these. His method is largely allegorical.
For the text of scripture he uses both the Latin versions, the
Itala and the Vulgate, often comparing them together. But he
certainly knew Greek, and possibly some Hebrew. Indeed it
may be said that his works, scientific, historical and theological,
practically sum up all the learning of western Europe in his time,
which he thus made available for his countrymen. And not for
them only; for in the school of York, founded by his pupil
Archbishop Ecgberht, was trained Alcuin (Ealhwine) the initiator
under Charles the Great of the Frankish schools, which did so
much for learning on the continent. And though Bede makes
no pretensions to originality, least of all in his theological works,
freely taking what he needed, and (what is very rare in medieval
writers) acknowledging what he took, &ldquo;out of the works of the
venerable Fathers,&rdquo; still everything he wrote is informed and
impressed with his own special character and temper. His
earnest yet sober piety, his humility, his gentleness, appear in
almost every line. &ldquo;In history and in science, as well as in
theology, he is before all things the Christian thinker and
student.&rdquo; (Plummer&rsquo;s <i>Bede</i>, i. 2.) Yet it should not be forgotten
that Bede could hardly have done what he did without the noble
library of books collected by Benedict Biscop.</p>

<p>Several quaint and beautiful legends have been handed down
as to the origin of the epithet of &ldquo;venerable&rdquo; generally attached
to his name. Probably it is a mere survival of a title commonly
given to priests in his day. It has given rise to a false idea that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page616" id="page616"></a>616</span>
he lived to a great age; some medieval authorities making him
ninety when he died. But he was not born before 672 (see above);
and though the date of his death has been disputed, the traditional
year, 735, is most probably correct. This would make
him at most sixty-three. Of his death a most touching and
beautiful account has been preserved in a contemporary letter.
His last hours were spent, like the rest of his life, in devotion and
teaching, his latest work being to dictate, amid ever-increasing
bodily weakness, a translation into the vernacular of the Gospel
of St John, a work which unhappily has not survived. It was a
fitting close to such a life as his.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The above sketch is largely based on the present
writer&rsquo;s essay on Bede&rsquo;s Life and Works, prefixed to his edition of Bede&rsquo;s
<i>Historia Ecclesiastica, &amp;c.</i> (2 vols., Clarendon Press, 1896). <i>Beda der
Ehrwurdige und seine Zeit</i>, by Dr Karl Werner (Vienna, 1875), is
excellent. Gehle, <i>Disputatio ... de Bedae vita et Scriptis</i> (Leiden,
1838), is still useful. Dr William Bright&rsquo;s <i>Chapters of Early English
Church History</i> (3rd ed., Clarendon Press, 1897) is indispensable.
See also Ker, <i>Dark Ages</i>, pp. 141 ff. Of the collected works of Bede
the most convenient edition is that by Dr Giles in twelve volumes
(8vo., 1843-1844), which includes translations of the <i>Historical Works</i>.
The Continental folio editions (Basel, 1563; Cologne, 1612 and 1688)
contain many works which cannot by any possibility be Bede&rsquo;s.
The edition of Migne, <i>Patralogia Latina</i> (1862 ff.) is based on a
comparison of the Cologne edition with Giles and Smith (see below), and
is open to the same criticism. On the chronology and genuineness of
the works commonly ascribed to Bede, see Plummer&rsquo;s ed., i., cxlv-clix.</p>

<p>On the MSS. early editions and translations of the <i>Historia
Ecclesiastica</i>, see Plummer, <i>u.s.</i>, i., lxxx-cxxxii. The edition of
Whelock (Cambridge, fol. 1643-1644) is noteworthy as the first
English edition of the Latin text, and as the <i>editio princeps</i> of the
Anglo-Saxon version ascribed to King Alfred (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alfred the
Great</a></span>). Smith&rsquo;s edition (Cambridge, fol. 1722) contained not only
these, but also the other historical works of Bede, with notes and
appendices. It is a monument of learning and scholarship. The
most recent edition is that with notes and introduction by the
present writer, u.s. It includes also the <i>History of the Abbots</i>, and
the Epistle to Egbert. Of books iii. and iv. only, there is a learned
edition by Professors Mayor and Lumby of Cambridge (3rd ed., 1881).
A cheap and handy edition of the text alone is that by A. Holder
(Freiburg im Breisgau, 1882, &amp;c.). The best-known modern English
translation is that by the Rev. L. Gidley (1870). Of the minor
historical works a good edition was edited by Rev. J. Stevenson for
the Eng. Hist. Soc. in 1841; and a translation by the same hand
was included in <i>Church Historians of England</i>, vol. i., part ii. (1853).

<p><span class="bold">BEDELL, WILLIAM<a name="ar260" id="ar260"></a></span> (1571-1642), Anglican divine, was born
at Black Notley in Essex, in 1571. He was educated at Cambridge,
became fellow of Emmanuel in 1593, and took orders.
In 1607 he was appointed chaplain to Sir H. Wotton, then
English ambassador at Venice, where he remained for four years,
acquiring a great reputation as a scholar and theologian. He
translated the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> into Italian, and was on
terms of closest friendship with the reformer, Sarpi (Fra Paolo).
In 1616 he was appointed to the rectory of Horningsheath (near
to Bury St Edmunds, where he had previously laboured), which he
held for twelve years. In 1627 he became provost of Trinity
College, Dublin, and, in 1629, bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh.
He set himself to reform the abuses of his diocese, encouraged the
use of the Irish language, and personally undertook the duties
generally discharged by the bishop&rsquo;s lay chancellor. In 1633
he resigned his see. In 1641, when the Protestants were being
massacred, Bedell&rsquo;s house was not only left untouched, but became
the place of refuge for many fugitives. In the end, however,
the rebels insisted upon the dismissal of all who had taken
shelter in his house, and on the bishop&rsquo;s refusal he was seized
and imprisoned with some others in the ruined castle of
Loughboughter. Here he was detained for several weeks, and when
released, rapidly sank from the effects of exposure, and died
on the 7th of February 1642.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEDESMAN,<a name="ar261" id="ar261"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Beadsman</span> (Med. Eng. <i>bede</i>, prayer, from
O. Eng. <i>biddan</i>, to pray; literally &ldquo;a man of prayer&rdquo;), generally
a pensioner or almsman whose duty it was to pray for his
benefactor. In Scotland there were public almsmen supported by
the king and expected in return to pray for his welfare and that
of the state. These men wore long blue gowns with a pewter
badge on the right arm, and were nicknamed Blue Gowns.
Their number corresponded to the king&rsquo;s years, an extra one being
added each royal birthday. They were privileged to ask alms
throughout Scotland. On the king&rsquo;s birthday each bedesman
received a new blue gown, a loaf, a bottle of ale, and a leathern
purse containing a penny for every year of the king&rsquo;s life. On
the pewter badge which they wore were their name and the
words &ldquo;pass and repass,&rdquo; which authorized them to ask alms.
In 1833 the appointment of bedesmen was stopped. In 1863
the last payment was paid to a bedesman. In consequence of
its use in this general sense of pensioner, &ldquo;bedesman&rdquo; was long
used in English as equivalent to &ldquo;servant.&rdquo; The word had a
special sense as the name for those almsmen attached to cathedral
and other churches, whose duty it was to pray for the souls of
deceased benefactors. A relic of pre-Reformation times, these
old men still figure in the accounts of English cathedrals.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEDFORD, EARLS AND DUKES OF<a name="ar262" id="ar262"></a></span>. The present English
title of duke of Bedford comes from a line of earls and dukes
in the Russell family. In January 1550 John, Baron Russell,
was created earl of Bedford, and in May 1694 his descendant,
William, the 5th earl, became duke of Bedford. The Russell
line is dealt with in the later part of this article. The title of
duke of Bedford had, however, been previously held, notably
by the third son of Henry IV.; and the earlier creations may first
be considered here.</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Plantagenet</span>, duke of Bedford (1389-1435), third son
of Henry IV., king of England, was born on the 20th of June
1389. He received various dignities after his father became
king in 1399, and gained his early experiences in warfare when
he undertook the office of warden of the east marches of Scotland
in 1404; he was fairly successful in this command, which he
held until September 1414. In the previous May his brother, the
new king Henry V., had created him duke of Bedford, and after
resigning the wardenship he began to take a leading part in the
royal councils. He acted as lieutenant of the kingdom during
Henry&rsquo;s expedition to France in 1415, and in August 1416 commanded
the ships which defeated the French fleet at the mouth
of the Seine, and was instrumental in relieving Harfleur. Again
appointed lieutenant in July 1417, he marched against the
Scots, who abandoned the siege of Berwick at his approach; and
on his return to London he brought Sir John Oldcastle to trial
and was present at his execution. He appears to have governed
the country with considerable success until December 1419,
when he resigned his office as lieutenant and joined the king
in France. Returning to England, he undertook the lieutenancy
for the third time in June 1421, and in the following May
conducted the queen to join Henry in Normandy. He then took
his brother&rsquo;s place and led the English troops to the relief of
Cosne, but on hearing of the king&rsquo;s serious illness he left the army
and hurried to his side. Henry&rsquo;s last wish was that Bedford
should be guardian of the kingdom and of the young king, and
that Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, should act as regent
in France. But when Philip declined to undertake this office,
it too was assumed by Bedford, who, after the death of the French
king Charles VI. in October 1422, presided at a session of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page617" id="page617"></a>617</span>
parlement of Paris, and compelled all present to take an oath
of fidelity to King Henry VI. Meanwhile the English parliament
had decided that Bedford should be &ldquo;protector and defender&rdquo; of
the kingdom, and that in his absence the office should devolve
upon his brother Humphrey, duke of Gloucester. Confining
himself to the conduct of affairs in France the protector took
up Henry V.&rsquo;s work of conquest, captured Meulan and other
places, and sought to strengthen his position by an alliance
with Philip of Burgundy. This task was rendered more difficult
as Gloucester had just married Jacqueline, countess of Holland
and Hainaut, a union which gave the English duke a claim
on lands which Philip hoped to secure for himself. Bedford,
however, having allayed Philip&rsquo;s irritation, formed an alliance
with him and with John VI., duke of Brittany, at Amiens in
April 1423, and himself arranged to marry Anne, a sister of the
Burgundian duke. This marriage was celebrated at Troyes
in the following June, and the war against Charles, the dauphin
of France, was prosecuted with vigour and success. Bedford
sought to restore prosperity to the districts under his rule by
reforming the debased coinage, granting privileges to merchants
and manufacturers, and removing various abuses. He then
granted some counties to Philip to check the growing hostility
between him and Gloucester, and on the 17th of August 1424
gained a great victory over a combined army of French and Scots
at Verneuil. But in spite of the efforts of the protector the good
understanding between England and Burgundy was partially
destroyed when Gloucester invaded Hainaut in October 1424.
The ambition of his brother gave Bedford trouble in another
direction also; for on his return from Hainaut Gloucester
quarrelled with the chancellor, Henry Beaufort, bishop of
Winchester, and the council implored Bedford to come to England
to settle this dispute. He reached London in January 1426, and
after concluding a bond of alliance with Gloucester effected
a reconciliation between the duke and the chancellor; and
knighted the young king, Henry VI. Bedford then promised
to act in accordance with the will of the council, and in harmony
with the decision of this body raised a body of troops and
returned to France in March 1427. Having ordered Gloucester to
desist from a further attack on Hainaut, he threatened Brittany
and compelled Duke John to return to the English alliance;
and the success of his troops continued until the siege of Orleans,
to which he consented with reluctance, was undertaken in October
1428. Having assured himself that Philip was prepared to
desert him, Bedford sent orders to his army to raise the siege
in April 1429. He then acted with great energy and judgment in
attempting to stem the tide of disasters which followed this
failure, strengthened his hold upon Paris, and sent to England
for reinforcements; but before any engagement took place
he visited Rouen, where he sought to bind the Normans closer
to England, and after his return to Paris resigned the French
regency to Philip of Burgundy in accordance with the wish of
the Parisians. Retaining the government of Normandy Bedford
established himself at Rouen and directed the movements of
the English forces with some success. He did not interfere to
save the life of Joan of Arc. He was joined by Henry VI. in
April 1430, when the regency was temporarily suspended, and
he secured Henry&rsquo;s coronation at Paris in December 1431. In
November 1432 his wife Anne died, and in April 1433 he was
married at Therouanne to Jacqueline, daughter of Pierre I.,
count of St Pol. But notwithstanding Bedford&rsquo;s vigour the
English lost ground steadily; and the death of Anne and
this marriage destroyed the friendly relations between England
and Burgundy. Negotiations for peace had no result, and when
the duke returned to England in June 1433 he told parliament
that he had come home to defend himself against the charge
that the losses in France were caused by his neglect, and
demanded that his detractors should make their accusations public.
The chancellor replied that no such charges were known to the
king or the council, and the duke was thanked for his great
services. His next act was to secure an inquiry into the national
finances; and when asked by the parliament to stay in England
he declared that his services were at the king&rsquo;s disposal. As
chief councillor he offered to take a smaller salary than had been
previously paid to Gloucester, and undertook this office in
December 1433, when his demands with regard to a continual
council were conceded. Bedford, who was anxious to prosecute
the war in France, left England again in 1434, but early in
1435 was obliged to consent to the attendance of English r
epresentatives at a congress held to arrange terms of peace at Arras.
Unable to consent to the French terms the English envoys left
Arras in September, and Philip of Burgundy made a separate
treaty with France. Bedford only lived to see the ruin of the
cause for which he struggled so loyally. He died at Rouen
on the 14th of September 1435, and was buried in the cathedral
of that city. He left a natural son, Richard, but no legitimate
issue. Bedford was a man of considerable administrative ability,
brave and humane in war, wise and unselfish in peace. He was
not responsible for the misfortunes of the English in France,
and his courage in the face of failure was as admirable as his
continued endeavour to make the people under his rule contented
and prosperous.</p>

<p>In 1470 <span class="sc">George Nevill</span> (<i>c.</i> 1457-1483), son of John, earl of
Northumberland, was created duke of Bedford; but after his
father&rsquo;s attainder and death at the battle of Barnet in 1471
he was degraded from the peerage.</p>

<p>The next duke of Bedford was <span class="sc">Jasper Tudor</span> (<i>c.</i> 1430-1495),
half-brother of King Henry VI. and uncle of Henry VII. He
was made earl of Pembroke in 1453. Having survived the
vicissitudes of the Wars of the Roses he was restored to his
earldom and created duke of Bedford in 1485. The duke, who
was lord-lieutenant of Ireland from 1486 to 1494, died without
legitimate issue on the 21st of December 1495.</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Russell</span>, 1st earl of Bedford (<i>c.</i> 1486-1555), was a son
of James Russell (d. 1509). Having travelled widely, he attained
some position at the court of Henry VII., and was subsequently
in great favour with Henry VIII. In 1513 he took part in the
war with France, and, having been knighted about the same
time, was afterwards employed on several diplomatic errands.
He was with Henry at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520,
and, returning to military service when the French war was
renewed, lost his right eye at the siege of Morlaix in 1522. He
was soon made knight marshal of the royal household, and in
1523 went secretly to France, where he negotiated a treaty
between Henry and Charles, duke of Bourbon, who was anxious
to betray the French king Francis I. After a short visit to
England Russell was sent with money to Bourbon, joining the
constable at the siege of Marseilles. In 1524 he visited Pope
Clement VII. at Rome, and, having eluded the French, who
endeavoured to capture him, was present at the battle of Pavia
in February 1525, returning to England about the close of the
year. In January 1527 he was sent as ambassador to Clement,
who employed him to treat on his behalf with Charles de Lannoy,
the general of Charles V. The next few years of Russell&rsquo;s life
were mainly spent in England. He was member of parliament
for Buckingham in the parliament of 1529, and although an
opponent of the party of Anne Boleyn, retained the favour of
Henry VIII. He took an active part in suppressing the
Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536, and was one of the commissioners
appointed to try the Lincolnshire prisoners. Honours now
crowded upon him. His appointment as comptroller of the
king&rsquo;s household in 1537 was followed by that of a privy councillor
in 1538; then he was made lord high admiral, high steward
of the duchy of Cornwall and a knight of the garter. In March
1539 he was created Baron Russell of Chenies, and in 1542
became high steward of the university of Oxford, and keeper of
the privy seal. In 1539, when Charles V. and Francis I. were
threatening to invade England, he was sent into the west, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page618" id="page618"></a>618</span>
crossed to France when Henry attacked Francis in 1544. He
was in command of an army in the west of England in 1545, and
when Henry died in January 1547 was one of the executors of
his will. Under Edward VI. Russell was lord high steward and
keeper of the privy seal, and the defeat which he inflicted on
the rebels at Clyst St Mary near Exeter in August 1549, was
largely instrumental in suppressing the rising in Devonshire.
In January 1550 he was created earl of Bedford, and was one of
the commissioners appointed to make peace with France in
this year. He opposed the proposal to seat Lady Jane Grey on
the throne; supported Queen Mary, who reappointed him lord
privy seal; and assisted to prevent Sir Thomas Wyat&rsquo;s rising
from spreading to Devonshire. In 1554 he went to Spain to
conclude the marriage treaty between Mary and Philip II., and
soon after his return died in London on the 14th of March 1555.
By extensive acquisitions of land Bedford was the founder of
the wealth and greatness of the house of Russell. Through his
wife, Anne (d. 1550), daughter of Sir Guy Sapcote, whom he
married in 1526, he obtained Chenies, and in 1539 was granted
the forest of Exmoor, and also Tavistock, and a number of
manors in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, which had formerly
belonged to the abbey of Tavistock. In 1549 he received
Thorney, the abbey of Woburn, and extensive lands in the
eastern counties; and in 1552 Covent Garden and seven acres of
land in London, formerly the property of the protector Somerset.
He left an only son, Francis, who succeeded him in the title.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Francis Russell</span>, 2nd earl of Bedford (<i>c.</i> 1527-1585), was
educated at King&rsquo;s Hall, Cambridge. He accompanied his
father to the French war in 1544, and from 1547 to 1552 was
member of parliament for Buckinghamshire, being probably the
first heir to a peerage to sit in the House of Commons. He
assisted to quell the rising in Devonshire in 1549, and after his
father had been created earl of Bedford in January 1550, was
known as Lord Russell, taking his seat in the House of Lords
under this title in 1552. Russell was in sympathy with the
reformers, whose opinions he shared, and was in communication
with Sir Thomas Wyat; and in consequence of his religious
attitude was imprisoned during the earlier part of Mary&rsquo;s reign.
Being released he went into exile; visited Italy; came into
touch with foreign reformers; and fought at the battle of St
Quentin in 1557. Afterwards he seems to have enjoyed some
measure of the royal favour, and was made lord-lieutenant of
the counties of Devon, Cornwall and Dorset early in 1558.
When Elizabeth ascended the throne in November 1558 the earl
of Bedford, as Russell had been since 1555, became an active
figure in public life. He was made a privy councillor, and was
sent on diplomatic errands to Charles IX. of France and Mary
queen of Scots. From February 1564 to October 1567 he was
governor of Berwick and warden of the east marches of Scotland,
in which capacity he conducted various negotiations between
Elizabeth and Mary. He appears to have been an efficient
warden, but was irritated by the vacillating and tortuous
conduct of the English queen. When the northern insurrection
broke out in 1569, Bedford was sent into Wales, and he sat in
judgment upon the duke of Norfolk in 1572. In 1576 he was
president of the council of Wales, and in 1581 was one of the
commissioners deputed to arrange a marriage between Elizabeth
and Francis, duke of Anjou. Bedford, who was made a knight
of the garter in 1564, was lord warden of the Stannaries from
1553 to 1580. He appears to have been a generous and popular
man, and died in London on the 28th of July 1585. He was
buried at Chenies. His first wife was Margaret (d. 1562),
daughter of Sir John St John, by whom he had four sons and
three daughters. His three eldest sons predeceased their father.
His second wife was Bridget (d. 1601), daughter of John, Lord
Hussey. He was succeeded as 3rd earl by his grandson, <span class="sc">Edward</span>
(1572-1627), only son of Francis, Lord Russell (<i>c.</i> 1550-1585).
The 3rd earl left no children when he died on the 3rd of May
1627, and was succeeded by his cousin.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Francis Russell</span>, 4th earl of Bedford (1593-1641), was the
only son of William, Lord Russell of Thornhaugh, to which
barony he succeeded in August 1613. For a short time previously
he had been member of parliament for the borough of
Lyme Regis; in 1623 he was made lord-lieutenant of Devonshire;
and in May 1627 became earl of Bedford by the death of his
cousin, Edward, the 3rd earl. When the quarrel broke out
between Charles I. and the parliament, Bedford supported the
demands of the House of Commons as embodied in the Petition
of Right, and in 1629 was arrested for his share in the circulation
of Sir Robert Dudley&rsquo;s pamphlet, &ldquo;Proposition for His Majesty&rsquo;s
service,&rdquo; but was quickly released. The Short parliament meeting
in April 1640 found the earl as one of the king&rsquo;s leading
opponents. He was greatly trusted by John Pym and Oliver
St John, and is mentioned by Clarendon as among the &ldquo;great
contrivers and designers&rdquo; in the House of Lords. In July 1640
he was among the peers who wrote to the Scottish leaders
refusing to invite a Scottish army into England, but promising
to stand by the Scots in all legal and honourable ways; and his
signature was afterwards forged by Thomas, Viscount Savile,
in order to encourage the Scots to invade England. In the following
September he was among those peers who urged Charles to
call a parliament, to make peace with the Scots, and to dismiss
his obnoxious ministers; and was one of the English commissioners
appointed to conclude the treaty of Ripon. When the
Long parliament met in November 1640, Bedford was generally
regarded as the leader of the parliamentarians. In February
1641 he was made a privy councillor, and during the course of
some negotiations was promised the office of lord high treasurer.
He was essentially a moderate man, and seemed anxious to
settle the question of the royal revenue in a satisfactory manner.
He did not wish to alter the government of the Church, was on
good terms with Archbishop Laud, and, although convinced of
Stafford&rsquo;s guilt, was anxious to save his life. In the midst of
the parliamentary struggle Bedford died of smallpox on the
9th of May 1641. Clarendon described him as &ldquo;a wise man,
and of too great and plentiful a fortune to wish the subversion
of the government,&rdquo; and again referring to his death said that
&ldquo;many who knew him well thought his death not unseasonable
as well to his fame as his fortune, and that it rescued him as well
from some possible guilt as from those visible misfortunes which
men of all conditions have since undergone.&rdquo; Bedford was the
head of those who undertook to drain the great level of the fens,
called after him the &ldquo;Bedford level.&rdquo; He spent a large sum of
money over this work and received 43,000 acres of land, but
owing to various jealousies and difficulties the king took the
work into his own hands in 1638, making a further grant of land
to the earl. Bedford married Catherine (d. 1657), daughter of
Giles, 3rd Lord Chandos, by whom he had four sons and four
daughters. His eldest son, <span class="sc">William</span> (1613-1700), succeeded
him as 5th earl, fought first on the side of the parliament and
then on that of the king during the Civil War, and in 1694 was
created marquess of Tavistock and duke of Bedford.</p>

</div>

<p>The first duke, who married Anne (d. 1684), daughter of
Robert Carr, earl of Somerset, was succeeded in the title by his
grandson Wriothesley (1680-1711), who was a son of Lord
William Russell (<i>q.v.</i>) by his marriage with Rachel, daughter of
Thomas Wriothesley, 4th earl of Southampton, and who became
second duke in 1700. Eleven years later the second duke was succeeded
by his eldest son Wriothesley (1708-1732), who died without
issue in October 1732, when the title passed to his brother John.</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Russell</span>, 4th duke of Bedford (1710-1771), second
son of Wriothesley Russell, 2nd duke of Bedford, by his wife,
Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of John Howland of Streatham,
Surrey, was born on the 30th of September 1710. Known as Lord
John Russell, he married in October 1731 Lady Diana Spencer,
daughter of Charles, 3rd earl of Sunderland; became duke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page619" id="page619"></a>619</span>
Bedford on his brother&rsquo;s death a year later; and having lost his
first wife in 1735, married in April 1737 Lady Gertrude Leveson-Gower
(d. 1794), daughter of John, Earl Gower. In the House of
Lords he joined the party hostile to Sir Robert Walpole, took a
fairly prominent part in public business, and earned the dislike
of George II. When Carteret, now Earl Granville, resigned office
in November 1744, Bedford became first lord of the admiralty
in the administration of Henry Pelham, and was made a privy
councillor. He was very successful at the admiralty, but was
not equally fortunate after he became secretary of state for the
southern department in February 1748. Pelham accused him of
idleness; he was constantly at variance with the duke of Newcastle,
and resigned office in June 1751. Instigated by his friends
he was active in opposition to the government, and after Newcastle&rsquo;s
resignation in November 1756, became lord-lieutenant of
Ireland in the ministry of William Pitt and the duke of Devonshire,
retaining this office after Newcastle, in alliance with Pitt,
returned to power in June 1757. In Ireland he favoured a
relaxation of the penal laws against Roman Catholics, but did
not keep his promises to observe neutrality between the rival
parties, and to abstain from securing pensions for his friends.
His own courtly manners and generosity, and his wife&rsquo;s good
qualities, however, seem to have gained for him some popularity,
although Horace Walpole says he disgusted everybody. In
March 1761 he resigned this office. Having allied himself with
the earl of Bute and the party anxious to bring the Seven Years&rsquo;
War to a close, Bedford was noticed as the strongest opponent of
Pitt, and became lord privy seal under Bute after Pitt resigned
in October 1761. The cabinet of Bute was divided over the
policy to be pursued with regard to the war, but pacific counsels
prevailed, and in September 1762 Bedford went to France to
treat for peace. He was considerably annoyed because some of
the peace negotiations were conducted through other channels,
but he signed the peace of Paris in February 1763. Resigning
his office as lord privy seal soon afterwards, various causes of
estrangement arose between Bute and Bedford, and the subsequent
relations of the two men were somewhat virulent. The
duke refused to take office under George Grenville on Bute&rsquo;s
resignation in April 1763, and sought to induce Pitt to return to
power. A report, however, that Pitt would only take office on
condition that Bedford was excluded, incensed him and, smarting
under this rebuff, he joined the cabinet of Grenville as lord
president of the council in September 1763. His haughty manner,
his somewhat insulting language, and his attitude with regard
to the regency bill in 1765 offended George III., who sought
in vain to supplant him, and after this failure was obliged to
make humiliating concessions to the ministry. In July 1765,
however, he was able to dispense with the services of Bedford
and his colleagues, and the duke became the leader of a political
party, distinguished for rapacity, and known as the &ldquo;Bedford
party,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Bloomsbury gang.&rdquo; During his term of office
he had opposed a bill to place high import duties on Italian
silks. He was consequently assaulted and his London residence
attacked by a mob. He took some part in subsequent political
intrigues, and although he did not return to office, his friends,
with his consent, joined the ministry of the duke of Grafton in
December 1767. This proceeding led &ldquo;Junius&rdquo; to write his
&ldquo;letter to the duke of Bedford,&rdquo; one of especial violence. Bedford
was hostile to John Wilkes, and narrowly escaped from a
mob favourable to the agitator at Honiton in July 1769. His
health had been declining for some years, and in 1770 he became
partially paralysed. He died at Woburn on the 15th of January
1771, and was buried in the family burying place at Chenies.
His three sons all predeceased him, and he was succeeded in
the title by his grandson, Francis. The duke held many public
offices: lord-lieutenant of Bedfordshire and Devonshire, and
chancellor of Dublin University among others, and was a knight
of the garter. Bedford was a proud and conceited man, but
possessed both ability and common-sense. The important part
which he took in public life, however, was due rather to his
wealth and position than to his personal taste or ambition. He
was neither above nor below the standard of political morality
of the time, and was influenced by his duchess, who was very
ambitious, and by followers who were singularly unscrupulous.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Francis Russell</span>, 5th duke of Bedford (1765-1802), eldest
son of Francis Russell, marquess of Tavistock (d. 1767), by his
wife, Elizabeth (d. 1768), daughter of William Keppel, 2nd earl
of Albemarle, was baptized on the 23rd of July 1765. In January
1771 he succeeded his grandfather as duke of Bedford, and was
educated at Westminster school and Trinity College, Cambridge,
afterwards spending nearly two years in foreign travel. Regarding
Charles James Fox as his political leader, he joined the
Whigs in the House of Lords, and became a member of the circle
of the prince of Wales, afterwards George IV. Having overcome
some nervousness and educational defects, he began to speak
in the House, and soon became one of the leading debaters in
that assembly. He opposed most of the measures brought forward
by the ministry of William Pitt, and objected to the grant
of a pension to Edmund Burke, an action which drew down upon
him a scathing attack from Burke&rsquo;s pen. Bedford was greatly
interested in agriculture. He established a model farm at
Woburn, and made experiments with regard to the breeding
of sheep. He was a member of the original board of agriculture,
and was the first president of the Smithfield club. He died at
Woburn on the 2nd of March 1802, and was buried in the family
burying-place at Chenies. The duke was never married, and
was succeeded in the title by his brother, John.</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Russell</span>, 6th duke of Bedford (1766-1839), was succeeded
as seventh duke by his eldest son, Francis (1788-1861), who had
an only son, William (1809-1872), who became duke on his
father&rsquo;s death in 1861. When the eighth duke died in 1872, he
was succeeded by his cousin, Francis Charles Hastings (1819-1891),
who was member of parliament for Bedfordshire from
1847 until he succeeded to the title. The ninth duke was the

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEDFORD,<a name="ar263" id="ar263"></a></span> a municipal and parliamentary borough, and the
county town of Bedfordshire, England, 50 m. north-north-west of
London by the Midland railway; served also by a branch of the
London &amp; North-Western. Pop. (1901) 35,144. It lies in the
fertile valley of the Ouse, on both banks, but mainly on the north,
on which stands the mound which marks the site of the ancient
castle. The church of St Paul is Decorated and Perpendicular,
but its central tower and spire are modern; it contains the tomb
of Sir William Harper or Harpur (<i>c.</i> 1496-1573), lord mayor of
London, a notable benefactor of his native town of Bedford.
St Peter&rsquo;s church has in its central tower masonry probably of
pre-Conquest date; that of St Mary&rsquo;s is in part Norman, and
that of St John&rsquo;s Decorated; but the bodies of these churches
are largely restored. There are some remains of a Franciscan
friary of the 14th century. The Congregational chapel called
Bunyan&rsquo;s or the &ldquo;Old Meeting&rdquo; stands on the site of the building
in which John Bunyan preached from 1656 onward. His chair
is preserved here, and a tablet records his life in the town, where
he underwent a long but in part nominal imprisonment. He
was born at Elstow, 1½ m. from Bedford, where, while playing
on the green, he believed himself to have received the divine
summons to renounce sin. In the panels of a fine pair of bronze
doors in the chapel are scenes illustrative of Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i>. Bedford is noted for its grammar school, founded by
Edward VI. in 1552, and endowed by Sir William Harper. The
existing buildings date from 1891, and have been increased since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page620" id="page620"></a>620</span>
that date, and the school is one of the important public schools of
England. Harper&rsquo;s endowment includes land in London, and
is now of great value, and the Harper Trust supports in addition
modern and elementary schools for boys and girls, a girls&rsquo; high
school, and almshouses. The grammar school annually awards
both entrance exhibitions and two exhibitions to a university or
other higher educational institution. The old grammar school
buildings are used as a town hall; and among other modern
buildings may be mentioned the shire hall and county hospital.
There are statues of John Bunyan (1874) and John Howard
(1894) the philanthropist (1726-1790), who founded the
Congregational chapel which bears his name, and resided at
Cardington in the vicinity. There are two parks. Bedford has a
large trade as a market town for agricultural produce, and
extensive engineering works and manufactures of agricultural
implements. The parliamentary borough returns one member.
The municipal borough is under a mayor, 6 aldermen and
18 councillors. Area, 2223 acres.</p>

<p>Bedford (Bedcanforda, Bedanforda, Bedeford) is first
mentioned in 571, when Cuthwulf defeated the Britons here. It
subsequently became a Danish borough, which in 914 was
captured by Edward the Elder. In Domesday, as the county town,
it was entered apart from the rest of the shire, and was assessed
at half a hundred for the host and for ship service. The
prescriptive borough received its first charter from Henry II., who
gave the town to the burgesses to hold at a fee-farm rent of £40
in lieu of all service. The privileges included a gild-merchant,
all tolls, and liberties and laws in common with the citizens of
Oxford. This charter was confirmed by successive sovereigns
down to Charles II. During the 15th century, owing to the rise
of other market towns, Bedford became less prosperous, and the
fee-farm rent was finally reduced to £20 by charter of Henry VII.
Henry VIII. granted a November fair to St Leonard&rsquo;s hospital,
which was still held in the 19th century at St Leonard&rsquo;s farm,
the site of the hospital. Mary granted two fairs, one in Lent
and one on the Feast of the Conception, and also a weekly market.
A 17th century pamphlet on river navigation in Bedfordshire
mentions the trade which Bedford carried on in coal, brought by
the Ouse from Lynn and Yarmouth. The town was also one of
the earliest centres of the lace trade, to the success of which
French refugees in the 17th and 18th centuries largely contributed.</p>

<p>Bedford was represented in the parliament of 1295, and after
that date two members were returned regularly, until by the
Redistribution of Seats Act in 1885 Bedford lost one of its
members. The unlimited power of creating freemen, an inherent
right of the borough, led to great abuse, noticeably in 1769
when 500 freemen<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> were created to support the political interest
of Sir Robert Barnard, afterwards recorder of the borough.</p>

<p>Bedford castle, of which mention is first heard during Stephen&rsquo;s
reign (1136), was destroyed by order of Henry III. in 1224. The
mound marking its site is famous as a bowling-green.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEDFORD,<a name="ar264" id="ar264"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Lawrence county,
Indiana, U.S.A., in the south-central part of the state, about
60 m. north-west of Louisville, Kentucky. Pop. (1890) 3351;
(1910) 8716. It is served by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Southwestern,
the Chicago, Indianapolis &amp; Louisville, the Southern Indiana,
and (for freight from the Wallner quarries about 5 m. distant)
the Bedford &amp; Wallner railways. It is the shipping point of the
Bedford Indiana (oolitic) limestone, which is found in the vicinity
and is one of the most valuable and best known building stones
in the United States&mdash;of this stone were built the capitols of
Indiana, Georgia, Mississippi and Kentucky; the state historical
library at Madison, Wisconsin; the art building at St Louis,
Missouri; and many other important public buildings. The
city has large cement works, foundries and machine shops
(stone-working machinery being manufactured), and the repair
shops of the Southern Indiana railway. Bedford was settled in
1826 and received a city charter in 1889.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEDFORD,<a name="ar265" id="ar265"></a></span> a borough and the county-seat of Bedford county,
Pennsylvania, U.S.A., on the Raystown branch of the Juniata
river, about 35 m. south by west of Altoona. Pop. (1890) 2242;
(1910) 2235. Bedford is served by the Bedford branch of the
Pennsylvania railway. It lies in a beautiful valley. In the
borough are some interesting old houses, erected in the latter
part of the 18th century, an art gallery and a soldiers&rsquo; monument.
There are deposits of hematite and limestone near the borough,
and less than 2 m. south of it are the widely-known Bedford
Mineral Springs&mdash;a magnesia spring, a limestone spring, a sulphur
spring, and a &ldquo;sweet-water&rdquo; spring&mdash;which attract many
visitors during the summer season. There are also chalybeate
and other less important springs about the same distance east of
the borough, and a white sulphur spring 10 m. south-west of it.
Bedford has a large wholesale grocery trade, manufactures flour,
dressed lumber, kegs and handles, and is situated in a fine
fruit-growing district, especially known for its apples and plums.
The borough owns and operates the water works. A temporary
settlement was made on or near the site of the present borough
about 1750 by an Indian trader named Ray, and for a few years
the place was known as Raystown; the present name was
adopted not later than 1759. In July 1758 Fort Bedford, for
many years an important military post on the frontier, was
constructed, and here, later in the year, General John Forbes
brought together his troops preparatory to advancing against
Fort Duquesne. The town of Bedford was laid out in 1769, and
in 1771 it was made the county-seat of Bedford county which
was organized in that year. The borough was incorporated in
1795, and received a new charter in 1817. Washington came here
in 1794 to review the army sent to quell the Whisky Insurrection,
and the Espy house, which he then occupied, is still standing.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEDFORDSHIRE<a name="ar266" id="ar266"></a></span> [abbreviated Beds], a south midland county
of England, bounded N.E. by Huntingdonshire, E. by Cambridgeshire,
S.E. by Hertfordshire, W. by Buckinghamshire and N.W.
by Northamptonshire. It is the fourth smallest English county,
having an area of 466.4 sq. m. It lies principally in the middle
part of the basin of the river Ouse, which, entering in the north-west,
traverses the rich and beautiful Vale of Bedford with a
serpentine course past the county town of Bedford to the north-eastern
corner near St Neots. North of it the land is undulating,
but low; to the south, a well-wooded spur of the Chiltern Hills
separates the Vale of Bedford from the flat open tributary valley
of the Ivel. A small part of the main line of the Chilterns is
included in the south of the county, the hills rising sharply from
the lowland to bare heights exceeding 600 ft. above Dunstable.
In this neighbourhood the county includes the headwaters of the
Lea, and thus a small portion of it falls within the Thames basin.
In the north a few streams are tributary to the Nene.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology</i>.&mdash;The general trend of the outcrops of the various formations
is from south-west to north-east; the dip is south-easterly.
In the northern portion of the county, the Middle Oolites are the
most important, and of these, the Oxford Clay predominates over
most of the low ground upon which Bedford is situated. At Ampthill
a development of clay, the Ampthill clay, represents the Corallian
limestones of neighbouring counties. The Cornbrash is represented
by no more than about 2 ft. of limestone; but the Kellaways Rock
is well exposed near Bedford; the sandy parts of this rock are
frequently cemented to form hard masses called &ldquo;doggers.&rdquo; The
Great Ouse, from the point where it enters the county on the west,
has carved through the Middle Oolites and exposed the Great Oolite
as far as Bedford; their alternating limestones and clays may be
seen in the quarries not far from the town. From Woburn through
Ampthill to Potton a more elevated tract is formed by the Lower
Greensand. These rocks are sandy throughout. At Leighton
Buzzard they are dug on a large scale for various purposes. Beds of
fuller&rsquo;s earth occur in this formation at Woburn. At Potton,
phosphatized nodules may be obtained, and here a hard bed, the
&ldquo;Carstone,&rdquo; lies at the top of the formation. Above the Lower Greensand
comes the Gault Clay, which lies in the broad vale south-east of the
former and north-west of the Chalk hills. The Chalk rises up above
the Gault and forms the high ground of Dunshill Moors and the
Chiltern Hills. At the base of the Chalk is the Chalk Marl, above
this is the Totternhoe Stone, which, on account of its great hardness,
usually stands out as a well-marked feature. The Lower Chalk,
which comes next in the upward succession, is capped in a similar
manner by the hard Chalk Rock, as at Royston and elsewhere. The
upper Chalk-with-Flints occurs near the south-eastern boundary.
Patches of glacial boulder clay and gravel lie upon the older rocks
over most of the area. Many interesting mammalian fossils, rhinoceros,
mammoth, &amp;c., with palaeolithic implements, have been found
in the valley gravels of the river Ouse and its tributaries.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page621" id="page621"></a>621</span></p>

<p><i>Industries.</i>&mdash;Agriculture is important, nearly nine-tenths of
the total area being under cultivation. The chief crop is wheat,
for which the soil in the Vale of Bedford is specially suited;
while on the sandy loam of the Ivel valley, in the neighbourhood
of Biggleswade, market-gardening is extensively carried on,
the produce going principally to London, whither a considerable
quantity of butter and other dairy-produce is also sent. The
manufacture of agricultural machinery and implements employs
a large number of hands at Bedford and Luton. Luton, however,
is specially noted for the manufacture of straw hats. Straw-plaiting
was once extensively carried on in this neighbourhood
by women and girls in their cottage homes, but has now
almost entirely disappeared owing to the importation of Chinese
and Japanese plaited straw. Another local industry in the
county is the manufacture of pillow-lace. Many of the lace
designs are French, as a number of French refugees settled
in and near Cranfield. Mechlin and Maltese patterns are also
copied.</p>

<p><i>Communications</i> are provided in the east by the Great Northern
main line, passing Biggleswade, and in the centre by that of the
Midland railway, serving Ampthill and Bedford. The Bletchley
and Cambridge branch of the London &amp; North-Western railway
crosses these main lines at Bedford and Sandy respectively.
The main line of the same company serves Leighton Buzzard
in the south-west, and there is a branch thence to Dunstable,
which, with Luton, is also served by a branch of the Great
Northern line. A branch of the Midland railway south from
Bedford connects with the Great Northern line at Hitchin, and
formerly afforded the Midland access to London over Great
Northern metals.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The area of the ancient
county is 298,494 acres, with a population in 1891 of 161,704
and in 1901 of 171,240. The area of the administrative county
is 302,947 acres. The municipal boroughs are Bedford (pop.
35,144), Dunstable (5157) and Luton (36,404). The other urban
districts are&mdash;Ampthill (2177), Biggleswade (5120), Kempston,
connected with Bedford to the south-west (4729), and Leighton
Buzzard (6331). Potton (2033), Shefford (874), and Woburn
(1129) are lesser towns, and local centres of the agricultural
trade. The county is the midland circuit, and assizes are held at
Bedford. It has one court of quarter-sessions, and is divided
into eight petty sessional divisions. The boroughs of Bedford,
Dunstable and Luton have separate commissions of the peace,
and Bedford has a separate court of quarter-sessions. There are
133 civil parishes. Bedfordshire forms an archdeaconry in the
diocese of Ely, with 125 ecclesiastical parishes and parts of 6
others. The county has two parliamentary divisions, Northern
(or Biggleswade), and Southern (or Luton), each returning one
member; and Bedford is a parliamentary borough, returning
one member. The principal institution, apart from those in
the towns, is the great Three Counties asylum (for Bedfordshire,
Hertfordshire and Huntingdonshire), in the south-east of the
county near Arlesey.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Although the Saxon invaders were naturally
attracted to Bedfordshire by its abundant water supply and
facilities for agriculture, the remains of their settlements are
few and scattered. They occur, with one exception, south of the
Ouse, the most important being a cemetery at Kempston, where
two systems&mdash;cremation and earth-burial&mdash;are found side by
side. Early reference to Bedfordshire political history is scanty.
In 571 Cuthwulf inflicted a severe defeat on the Britons at Bedford
and took four towns. During the Heptarchy what is now the
shire formed part of Mercia; by the treaty of Wedmore, however,
it became Danish territory, but was recovered by King
Edward (919-921). The first actual mention of the county
comes in 1016 when King Canute laid waste to the whole shire.
There was no organized resistance to the conqueror within
Bedfordshire, though the Domesday survey reveals an almost
complete substitution of Norman for English holders. In the
civil war of Stephen&rsquo;s reign the county suffered severely; the
great Roll of the Exchequer of 1165 proves the shire receipts
had depreciated in value to two-thirds of the assessment for the
Danegeld. Again the county was thrown into the barons&rsquo; war
when Bedford Castle, seized from the Beauchamps by Falkes de
Breaute, one of the royal partisans, was the scene of three sieges
before it was demolished by the king&rsquo;s orders in 1224. The
peasants&rsquo; revolt (1377-1381) was marked by less violence here
than in neighbouring counties; the Annals of Dunstable make
brief mention of a rising in that town and the demand for and
granting of a charter. In 1638 ship-money was levied on Bedfordshire,
and in the Civil War that followed, the county was one
of the foremost in opposing the king. Clarendon observes that
here Charles had no visible party or fixed quarter.</p>

<p>Bedfordshire is divided into nine hundreds, Barford, Biggleswade,
Clifton, Flitt, Manshead, Redbornestoke, Stodden, Willey
and Wiscamtree, and the liberty, half hundred or borough of
Bedford. From the Domesday survey it appears that in the 11th
century there were three additional half hundreds, viz. Stanburge,
Buchelai and Weneslai, which had by the 14th century become
parts of the hundreds of Manshead, Willey and Biggleswade
respectively. Until 1574 one sheriff did duty for Bedfordshire
and Buckinghamshire, the shire court of the former being held
at Bedford. The jurisdiction of the hundred courts, excepting
Flitt, remained in the king&rsquo;s possession. Flitt was parcel of the
manor of Luton, and formed part of the marriage portion of
Eleanor, sister of Henry III. and wife of William Marshall. The
burgesses of Bedford and the prior of Dunstable claimed
jurisdictional freedom in those two boroughs. The <i>Hundred Rolls</i>
and the <i>Placita de quo warranto</i> show that important jurisdiction
had accrued to the great over-lordships, such as those of
Beauchamp, Wahull and Caynho, and to several religious
houses, the prior of St John of Jerusalem claiming rights in
more than fifty places in the county.</p>

<p>With regard to parliamentary representation, the first original
writ which has been discovered was issued in 1290 when two
members were returned for the county. In 1295 in addition
to the county members, writs are found for two members
to represent Bedford borough. Subsequently until modern
times two county and two borough members were returned
regularly.</p>

<p>Owing to its favourable situation Bedfordshire has always
been a prominent agricultural rather than manufacturing
county. From the 13th to the 15th century sheep farming
flourished, Bedfordshire wool being in request and plentiful.
Surviving records show that in assessments of wool to the king,
Bedfordshire always provided its full quota. Tradition says
that the straw-plait industry owes its introduction to James I.,
who transferred to Luton the colony of Lorraine plaiters whom
Mary queen of Scots had settled in Scotland. Similarly the lace
industry is associated with Catherine of Aragon, who, when
trade was dull, burnt her lace and ordered new to be made.
As late as the 19th century the lace makers kept &ldquo;Cattern&rsquo;s
Day&rdquo; as the holiday of their craft. The Flemings, expelled
by Alva&rsquo;s persecutions (1569), brought the manufacture of
Flemish lace to Cranfield, whence it spread to surrounding
districts. The revocation of the edict of Nantes, and consequent
French immigration, gave further impetus to the industry.
Defoe writing in 1724-1727 mentions the recent improvements
in the Bedfordshire bone-lace manufacture. In 1794 further
French refugees joined the Bedfordshire lace makers.</p>

<p>Woburn Abbey, belonging to the Russells since 1547, is the
seat of the duke of Bedford, the greatest landowner in the
county. The Burgoynes of Sutton, whose baronetcy dates from
1641, have been in Bedfordshire since the 15th century, whilst
the Osborn family have owned Chicksands Priory since its
purchase by Peter Osborn in 1576. Sir Phillip Monoux Payne
represents the ancient Monoux family of Wootton. Other
county families are the Crawleys of Stockwood near Luton,
the Brandreths of Houghton Regis, and the Orlebars of
Hinwick.</p>

<p>With the division of the Mercian diocese in 679 Bedfordshire
fell naturally to the new see of Dorchester. It formed part of
Lincoln diocese from 1075 until 1837, when it was finally transferred
to Ely. In 1291 Bedfordshire was an archdeaconry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page622" id="page622"></a>622</span>
including six rural deaneries, which remained practically unaltered
until 1880, when they were increased to eleven with a new
schedule of parishes.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;The monastic remains in Bedfordshire include
the fine fragment of the church of the Augustinian priory at
Dunstable, serving as the parish church; the church (also
imperfect) of Elstow near Bedford, which belonged to a
Benedictine nunnery founded by Judith, niece of William the
Conqueror; and portions of the Gilbertine Chicksands Priory
and of a Cistercian foundation at Old Warden. In the parish
churches, many of which are of great interest, the predominant
styles are Decorated and Perpendicular. Work of pre-Conquest
date, however, is found in the massive tower of Clapham church,
near Bedford on the north, and in a door of Stevington church.
Fine Norman and Early English work is seen at Dunstable and
Elstow, and the later style is illustrated by the large cruciform
churches at Leighton Buzzard and at Felmersham on the Ouse
above Bedford. Among the Perpendicular additions to the
church last named may be noted a very beautiful oaken rood-screen.
To illustrate Decorated and Perpendicular the churches
of Clifton and of Marston Moretaine, with its massive detached
campanile, may be mentioned; and Cople church is a good
specimen of fine Perpendicular work. The church of Cockayne
Hatley, near Potton, is fitted with rich Flemish carved wood,
mostly from the abbey of Alne near Charleroi, and dating from
1689, but brought here by a former rector early in the 19th
century. In medieval domestic architecture the county is not
rich. The mansion of Woburn Abbey dates from the middle of
the 18th century.</p>
